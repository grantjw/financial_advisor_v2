The sentiment for AAPL based on recent news is mixed. While the company reported good early results for its loyalty program, the macroeconomic environment is volatile and uneven. The company's revenue performance improved each quarter in 2023, and it is expanding its direct presence in emerging markets. However, the company's revenue from the extra week last year added approximately 7 percentage points to the quarter's total revenue, and the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks. The company expects iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis, but the year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories is expected to decelerate significantly from the September quarter. The company expects the average revenue per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. The company expects gross margin to be between 45% and 46%. The company expects OpEx to be between \$14.4 billion and \$14.6 billion, and OI&E to be around negative \$200 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and its tax-rate to be around 16%. The company's Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of \$0.24 per share of common stock, payable on November 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2023.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock\'s price, do they really matter?\nLet\'s take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.13, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 36 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.13 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 36 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 32 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 88.9% and 8.3% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>The ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock\'s future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock\'s price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs NVDA a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $10.74.\nAnalysts\' growing optimism over the company\'s earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.'}, {'url': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-nvda-beat-estimates-again-161010077.html', 'title': 'Will Nvidia NVDA Beat Estimates Again in', 'date': '*Dated: 2023-11-03*', 'text': ""If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Nvidia (NVDA). This company, which is in the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 23.83%.\nFor the last reported quarter, Nvidia came out with earnings of $2.70 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share, representing a surprise of 29.19%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.09 per share, delivering a surprise of 18.48%.\nFor Nvidia, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nNvidia currently has an Earnings ESP of +6.93%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 21, 2023.\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The SEC\'s subpoena exceeds the agency\'s investigative authority, is overly burdensome and seeks ""irrelevant evidence"", Musk\'s lawyers said in the filing.\nThe SEC has said it was investigating Musk\'s 2022 purchases of Twitter stock and his statements and SEC filings relating to Twitter -- which Musk subsequently renamed X -- and that Musk had refused to attend a September interview for the probe.\nAlex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, has called the investigation ""misguided.""\nOn Thursday, Spiro and Musk\'s other lawyers said in the filing: ""The SEC’s pursuit of Mr. Musk has crossed the line into harassment"".\nThe SEC did not respond immediately to requests for comment. The agency has previously said it is well within its authority to seek additional testimony from Musk and that it has received new documents in the investigation since last interviewing him.\nOn April 4, 2022, Musk disclosed he had acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter. It was 11 days after the SEC\'s deadline for such disclosures. Musk initially said he planned to be a passive stakeholder, meaning he did not plan to take over the company.\nLater that month, he announced plans to buy Twitter for $44 billion. He subsequently tried to get out of the deal, alleging Twitter was not disclosing the full extent of bot activity on its platform.\nAfter being sued to complete the deal, Musk closed his acquisition of Twitter in late October 2022.\nMusk has given the SEC documents relating to the probe and provided testimony in July last year via video conference, the SEC said in a court filing. But SEC attorneys said they have more questions for Musk after seeing the documents.\nThe SEC has issued 32 subpoenas in the investigation and has taken testimony from Musk and at least three other individuals seven times, Spiro said in a second filing. Musk alone has received five subpoenas for documents and another three for testimony, he said.\nThe SEC has spent 18 months ""devoting its formidable resources to investigating Mr. Musk over an allegedly untimely filing,"" the court filings said. ""This is just the latest chapter in a more-than-five-year saga of agency harassment against Mr. Musk and related entities.""\nThe court battle is the latest flare up in the acrimonious relationship between the U.S. market regulator and Musk, the world\'s wealthiest person.\nThe SEC sued Musk in 2018 over his posts on social media saying he had ""funding secured"" to take electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc private. Musk settled, but the regulator sued him again in 2019 alleging he had violated the terms of the agreement.\nMusk has meanwhile accused the agency of mounting ""endless"" investigations into him and Tesla.\nHe said he will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the legality of his SEC settlement, which requires him to vet some of his social media posts with a Tesla lawyer.

But in February 2019, testimony at the antitrust trial revealed Tuesday, Google internally declared a “Code Yellow” amid concerns the company might not meet its goals for search revenue for the quarter.\nAs part of the emergency, which lasted for seven weeks, engineers from Google’s search and Chrome browser teams were reassigned to figure out why user queries had slowed, according to the documents.\nBen Gomes, Google’s former head of search, was called by the company in its defense to show that it had made various advancements in search, particularly in mobile. However, cross examination by Justice Department lawyer David Dahlquist revealed the tensions between Gomes’ search team and its advertising counterparts.\nThe questioning sought to undermine Google’s contentions that its search team focuses solely on improving the user experience and has sometimes been pulled into the advertising side, where the Justice Department alleges Google has been able to raise prices without pushback.\nThe trial, now in its eighth week, focuses on whether Google has illegally maintained its monopoly by spending billions of dollars to stifle competition and preserve its monopoly over online search.\nEarlier: Google’s Pichai Refutes DOJ Allegations of Deleting Evidence\nIn a statement, Google pushed back on the idea that search results and innovation were affected by the company’s ad revenue goals. “The organic results you see in search are not affected by our ads systems or by the ads we show for a query,” said Peter Schottenfels, a Google spokesperson.\nGoogle argues that it has captured about 90% of the market for search on the merits of a superior product, and that its advancements in internet search have benefited the public. But emails revealed in court on Tuesday showed that there was some concern among key members of the company’s search team that Google was focused on growth over innovation.\nIn a 2019 email, Gomes wrote to other executives that his search team was “getting too close to the money.”\nEmails as Evidence\n“I think it is good for us to aspire to query growth and to aspire to more users. But I think we are getting too involved with ads for the good of the product and company,” Gomes wrote.\n“I am getting concerned that growth is all we are thinking about,” he ended the email.\nQuery growth is measured by looking at the number of user queries, which the Justice Department argued can translate to increased revenue, since greater queries provide more opportunities for Google to run search ads against them.\nGomes testified in court that he was feeling frustrated and sent the email at 6 a.m. At the time, Google set its metrics on the number of user queries, which Gomes said he believed wasn’t a good one since product improvements should help users find answers quickly.\n“I did not care for queries as a metric,” he said. “I think this metric of just using queries is not one that optimizes appropriately.”\nGoogle ended the “Code Yellow” emergency in mid-March.

Based on the recent news, NVDA appears to be a good stock to buy. The company has a strong history of beating earnings estimates, and its recent earnings surprise history has been positive. Additionally, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for NVDA is positive, indicating that another beat is possible. The Zacks Rank for NVDA is also #1 (Strong Buy), which is a good sign. However, it is important to note that the ABR (Average Brokerage Recommendation) for NVDA is 1.13, which is between Strong Buy and Buy. Therefore, it may be beneficial to use the ABR in conjunction with other factors, such as the Zacks Rank and Earnings ESP, when making an investment decision.",16.289499282836914,,"[{'url': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-nvidia-nvda-based-133006232.html', 'title': 'Is It Worth Investing in Nvidia NVDA Bas', 'date': '*Dated: 2023-11-03*', 'text': 'Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock\'s price, do they really matter?\nLet\'s take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.13, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 36 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.13 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 36 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 32 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 88.9% and 8.3% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>The ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock\'s future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock\'s price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs NVDA a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $10.74.\nAnalysts\' growing optimism over the company\'s earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.'}, {'url': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-nvda-beat-estimates-again-161010077.html', 'title': 'Will Nvidia NVDA Beat Estimates Again in', 'date': '*Dated: 2023-11-03*', 'text': ""If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Nvidia (NVDA). This company, which is in the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 23.83%.\nFor the last reported quarter, Nvidia came out with earnings of $2.70 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share, representing a surprise of 29.19%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.09 per share, delivering a surprise of 18.48%.\nFor Nvidia, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nNvidia currently has an Earnings ESP of +6.93%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 21, 2023.\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.\nJason Matthew Gerberry\nHi, good afternoon, this is (inaudible) for Jason. We just had a couple of questions on FG-3246. This is based on the activity that you're seeing in the NCR PC patients in the Phase I trial thus far, are you planning to assess 3246 in earlier lines. And I know you're planning to enrich for patients that expressed CD46. Could you just please remind us what percentage of the patient population you expect to be in the subgroup of CD46 expressors? Thank you so much.\nThane Wettig\nJohn?\nJohn J. Hunter\nYeah, in addition to the continued outstanding performance of roxadustat in China, the roxadustat launch in Europe is accelerating, showing robust quarter-over-quarter growth. We expect this growth to continue to accelerate given the strong competitive position of roxadustat. Roxadustat is the only HIF PHI indicated in the EU, thanks for the question. Just with regards to going into earlier lines, the enzalutamide combo study that's being run as an investigator-sponsored trial at UCSF does open the possibility of going into a first-line setting if that is positive. So we are following that carefully to see what those results look like and then we would make a decision, I think, based on those results.Just with regards to the percentage of patients who we expect to be positive we have a pretty limited data set at this point regarding expression by IHC for patients that either do or do not express CD46. We do think that the PET biomarker will give us much better data on that and really kind of guide our thinking. But based on the data that we have in hand right now, we've been estimating between 50% and 70% of the patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer will be CD46 positive. But I do want to stress that we are looking to acquire more data points to sort of firm that number up.And we won't be enriching in the Phase II trial. We're going to be assessing the patients ahead of treatment with our CD-46 and then once the efficacy results are in, then we'll do a correlation with the PET positivity and in the efficacy results.\nJason Matthew Gerberry\nGot it. And just a quick follow-up. Just thinking more broadly, kind of your strategy for this, Fortis potential acquisition during the next 4-year period, you have, obviously, success in this (inaudible) trial will be important. But do you have any plans to assess this indication or this asset in other indications in the next 4 years?\nJohn J. Hunter\nYes, we do. We've got the plans to do a tumor expansion trial as well. And it's just a matter of determining exactly when the right time is to do that tumor expansion trial, whether we go ahead and pull the trigger on it earlier or wait until we see some sort of an efficacy signal in the Phase II trial. We'll make that call at some point in the future. But yes, there are definitely plans and you heard John speak about multiple myeloma in his remarks as well.\nJason Matthew Gerberry\nThank you John.\nOperator\nThank you, I'll now hand the call back over to CEO, Thane Wettig, for any closing remarks.\nThane Wettig\nWell, thanks, everybody. We appreciate your participation in today's investor call and your interest in FibroGen. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating.

(NASDAQ: DXCM), a global leader in real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) for people with diabetes, announced today new market research which found 79% of people struggle to keep their glucose levels in range, and that almost half (45%) don’t understand what a Hybrid Closed Loop System (HCL) is or how HCL could benefit them1-2. Findings also showed that 99% of healthcare providers expect the NICE TA for HCL systems will somewhat or significantly help change the lives of people living with type 1 diabetes for the better1-2.\nDexcom’s research follows the new Technology Appraisal (TA) from NICE which provides detailed guidance for hybrid closed loop systems usage. The new TA impacts an eligible population of over 150,000 people living with Type 1 diabetes in England, providing access to HCL systems3. Those eligible include people living with type 1 diabetes who are under the age of 18 or those who are over 18 with either an HbA1c of 7.5% or who are experiencing disabling hypoglycaemia, the TA also impacts women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, and people already using an insulin pump3.\nSometimes known as an ‘artificial pancreas’, an HCL system works by linking an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor (CGM) with a computer algorithm that can calculate the amount of insulin someone needs based on their blood glucose readings.\n""It\'s a cause for celebration that hybrid closed loop systems are now a possibility for around 150,000 people with type 1 diabetes"" says Partha Kar, National Specialty Advisor, Diabetes with NHS England. ""This guidance would not have been possible without the support of our industry partners investing in new innovations and advancing technology for diabetes management. Today we are one step closer to providing access to life changing technology for more people with diabetes.""\nKaren Baxter, VP for UK Ireland Benelux Spain and France for Dexcom comments: ""It is clear from our research1-2 that so many more people could benefit from HCL. Every single person (100%) surveyed with type 1 diabetes said that being on an HCL system has reduced the burden of managing their diabetes and 98% of healthcare practitioners say they would want all people with type 1 diabetes to have access to HCL. The newly announced TA from NICE3 is a great advancement in access to diabetes technology.\n""As such, to support healthcare professionals with their understanding of the benefits of HCL systems for patients with diabetes, Dexcom has worked with the clinical experts at the Diabetes Technology Network (DTN) to launch a series of education modules encompassing everything they need to know about the technology, we are excited to play a key role in widening access to HCL as a result.""\nCelebrity Dexcom Warrior and HCL user, actor Jeremy Irvine† comments: ""I can honestly say using the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitoring device to power my HCL system has changed my life. I can’t imagine going back to finger pricks* and blood glucose monitoring, and I certainly couldn’t do the intense filming I’ve been doing without my HCL system.""\nDexcom is the most connected continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) brand in the world7, it is backed by over 28 studies8‡§, has powered HCL systems for over one million years of cumulative patient use7, and is a critical and essential component of an HCL system.'}]"

If you want to skip our analysis of mid cap investing and the stock market, then check out 5 Undervalued Mid Cap Stocks To Buy. \nWhen it comes to selecting stocks, different sectors allow investors to cater to different strategies. These depend on risk preference, the investing strategy, the fundamentals of the firm, and the broader economic environment among other factors, all of which carry the chances of making or breaking an investment portfolio.\nOne category of stocks that offers the chance of strong returns and also provides some buffer against losses is the mid cap stock category. These stocks have a market capitalization that ranges between $2 billion and $20 billion, and they typically belong to sizeable companies with well developed markets. Additionally, since their shares are often cheaper than the large cap and mega cap stocks, they offer a chance for stronger returns if the conditions are right. However, at the same time, mid cap companies are not as well insulated against external shocks due to smaller balance sheets than their mega and large cap peers. This makes the investment riskier if the economy is not performing well as during such times money generally flows either to consumer defensive stocks that have a nearly guaranteed and stable market or large cap companies which often have billions of dollars in cash and assets to withstand severe economic storms.\nBut what about returns? After all, some of the factors that we've outlined above are qualitative factors, investing is often a mathematical game. Well, mid cap stock performance actually carries the potential of outpacing the performance of broader market indexes and the small cap sector according to research from S&P Global. The firm behind the notable S&P 500 index outlines that when we map out and compare the returns of the S&P500, the S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600 stock indexes over a period of two decades starting from 1994, then mid cap stocks often outperform both the S&P500 and small cap stocks. This performance is actually agnostic of market conditions, meaning that the trend persists regardless of whether the market as a whole is doing well or not. In fact, the data shows that mid cap stocks can post stronger returns than other stocks when a market is doing well, such as during the six years between March 2009 and August 2015, and lag other stocks in losses during a downturn such as the sixteen months between October 2007 and March 2009.\nThis mid cap advantage is also visible in an extension of the results of a well known research paper by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French. The research paper took a look at stock returns from 1926 to 1992, and its data was expanded by Wespath Institutional Investments to analyze stock returns until 2018. The data shows that during this time period, while large cap stocks delivered 9.7% in annual returns, mid cap returns stood at 11.9% which was even higher than small cap returns which were 11.6%. This shows that there might be more at play than simply the lower share prices helping returns as we would assume when analyzing the difference in returns between large and mid cap stocks.\nThis is because if only lower prices were driving the higher returns, then small cap stocks would have returned more. One reason why mid cap stock returns are higher than small cap returns could be the well known Efficient Market Hypothesis, which assumes that the market price of a stock is its fair value as investors have all the information that they need to make an investing decision. Since mid cap stocks see more analyst coverage than small cap stocks, investors could be more confident about their decisions when investing in these companies, and when this is coupled with the inherent advantage of lower priced stocks being capable of delivering higher returns, then the out performance of mid cap stocks over large cap stocks might be unsurprising.\nShifting gears to focus on the stock market, right now it's earnings season on Wall Street. Stocks saw some action in early October when strong earnings results by big banks lifted market sentiment. The onset of the earnings season has buoyed indexes at some level, despite worrying news from the Middle East and inflation data that shows that the Federal Reserve might not have reached the end of its interest rate hiking cycle.""}, {'url': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/11f4b988-cd2d-3614-8e49-60ad34396700/3-stock-split-stocks-due-for.html', 'title': '3 StockSplit Stocks Due for Another Spli', 'date': '*Dated: 2023-11-01*', 'text': 'Stock splits have become more common with tech stocks in recent years, even though such actions change little on the surface.

And Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Hartnett says technical factors no longer stand in the way of a year-end rally in stocks.\nThe bank’s in-house sentiment gauge, the Bull & Bear Indicator, is flashing a contrarian buy signal for a third straight week amid poor equity market breadth — a reference to the number of stocks rising — and large outflows from high-yield and emerging-market bonds, the strategist wrote in a note. The indicator has slid to 1.4, below the 2 level that BofA says implies a buy signal.\nMeantime, BofA’s Savita Subramanian says the S&P 500 offers a better entry point now relative to its July peak — and “the probability of a positive surprise in higher beta stocks is high,” while noting that the frequency of clients asking whether they should wait to buy equities has increased.\n“Extreme fear can be just as costly as greed,” she wrote.\nWhile the stock market has enjoyed a powerful rebound this week, lurking beneath the euphoric surface are still fears about Corporate America’s profit outlook.\nAmong companies that have issued guidance this earnings season for next quarter and beyond, more have been providing estimates that trail analysts’ expectations. A gauge of forward guidance that compares corporate forecasts with the Wall Street consensus has been lower only once since 2019, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.\n‘Manic Dispersion’\nThe litany of bullish calls for both the stock and bond markets that have been resounding should be an obvious signal that investor sentiment (at best) remains neutral and (at worst) will quickly revert back toward bullish extremes, according to Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott.\n“Such manic dispersion in outlook implies that the markets may likely need more time to find their footing, and could even see lower levels over the coming months,” he noted. “Our work points to more volatility ahead.”\nMeantime, bonds are looking attractive and set to beat cash over the next year as inflation cools and central banks end policy tightening, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s head of asset allocation strategy.\n“Bonds are starting to offer an attractive entry point,” said Christian Mueller-Glissmann. “Central banks are very close or already at the end of their rate-hiking cycle. We also recognize the pressure that comes from rising long-dated bond yields on the economy. Those factors set investors up nicely for a much better starting point for buying bonds.”\nCorporate Highlights:\nApple Inc., which is trying to reverse several successive quarters of revenue decline, reported its lowest revenue from the greater China region since mid-2022.\nThe US threw its support behind JetBlue Airways Corp.’s attempt to fight expulsion from Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport.\nCarvana Co. beat Wall Street’s expectations in the third quarter, defying the challenges posed by rising interest rates and high inflation.\nFortinet Inc. cut its annual guidance a second time and projecting that fourth-quarter billings and revenue will fall short of expectations.\nCoinbase Global Inc.’s revenue increased more than forecast as the largest US crypto exchange sought to weather an industrywide decline in trading activity.\nDraftKings Inc., the online sportsbook, reported third-quarter sales and monthly unique players that beat consensus estimates.\nBooking Holdings Inc. said travel demand had been diminished by the Israel-Hamas war, even while forecasting growth and reporting earnings that beat expectations.\nThe company has greater exposure in Europe and the Middle East than rivals such as Expedia Group Inc.\nBlock Inc., the payments giant run by Jack Dorsey, again boosted its forecast for adjusted profit for the year as customers increasingly turn to its popular Cash App.\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is poised to show that persistently high interest rates have helped the conglomerate more than they hindered it.'}, {'url': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6257f16c-d941-3728-b62d-addf4faac0ad/dow-jones-roars-as-palantir.html', 'title': 'Dow Jones Roars As Palantir Spikes Apple', 'date': '*Dated: 2023-11-03*', 'text': 'The market rallied strongly again Thursday, with Palantir a big winner.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock\'s price, do they really matter?\nLet\'s take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Nvidia (NVDA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nNvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.13, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 36 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.13 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 36 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 32 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 88.9% and 8.3% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDA\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Nvidia here>>>The ABR suggests buying Nvidia, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock\'s future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock\'s price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIs NVDA a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $10.74.\nAnalysts\' growing optimism over the company\'s earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.'}]"

It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

The sentiment towards Tesla based on the latest news is negative. The stock has sold off after Elon Musk tempered expectations for the company's new Cybertruck. Additionally, Tesla shares have wiped out nearly one-fifth of their value in less than two weeks amid growing concerns that demand for electric cars is starting to weaken. The selloff started earlier this month when the electric-vehicle giant dialed back growth expectations during its third quarter earnings call. That was followed by grim commentary from several global automakers, as well as Wall Street analysts. This week, battery-maker Panasonic Holdings Corp. and chipmaker ON Semiconductor Corp. also sounded alarms for the EV industry. The warnings have weighed on stocks across the US automotive sector, which has also been battling extensive negotiations with its labor unions over wages.

Sure, James. Happy to address that. The third quarter, we're really pleased with our above-expectation performance both on the measurement and optimization side. Two things that are worth noting, I talked about this a bit in the script, is that we saw stronger-than-expected growth in T&E, which is our second largest vertical. We expect that to moderate in the fourth quarter. And then secondly, we did see very strong growth in context control, double digit with multiple factors driving that growth. But as we have shared in the past, we do expect context control growth to moderate in the fourth quarter. But really pleased to be raising our guide for the fourth quarter by $2 million at the midpoint.\nJames Edward Heaney\nGreat. Thanks for that. And Lisa, could you just talk more about the traction that you're getting on the TikTok product? I think you're now live in like 50 countries. Just talk about the contribution from that product and how to think about the roadmap for 2024. Thank you.\nLisa Utzschneider\nYes. Great question, James. With TikTok, we are firing on all cylinders across social platforms and including TikTok. We continue to drive customer adoption of our TMQ brand safety and suitability measurement product on TikTok. TMQ is now available to advertisers in 50 markets. That's up from 30 at the end of second quarter and ahead of our expectations of 40 markets by yearend. And then I know we had already said it previously on the call, but our active post-bid campaigns on TikTok more than doubled year-to-date, and impressions have quadrupled. We're just thrilled with our partnership with TikTok. We're thrilled with the fact that brands are leaning into our differentiated technology backed by ML/AI. And I'm incredibly proud of the team on just speed to market and again, delivering differentiated value for our brands.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald of Wells Fargo.\nBrian Nicholas Fitzgerald\nYes, I think that was me. Great to see the acceleration in optimization. We wanted to ask, among the larger customers that you have, you've done a great job with contextual penetration there. But wondering if you could talk about continued runway for optimization growth with those customers? Can they light up contextual more geos from more campaigns? And then wondering if you could talk about attention as well. Does that potentially drive a wave of adoption and growth similar to what you've seen with context control? How are you thinking about that?\nLisa Utzschneider\nSure. I'm happy to take both, Fitz. As I mentioned previously, we're -- a few things. We're pleased with the double-digit growth that we're seeing in context control for this quarter. And it's reflected both with the acceleration that we're seeing with mid-tier and then also it's driven by contribution that we're seeing from some of the large CPG logos that we signed several quarters ago. Mid-tier is an area that I know we've talked about last quarter, but we're very, very focused on driving the acceleration of the mid-tier channel. And again, we are seeing great growth quarter-over-quarter, more than doubling, and we'll continue to invest and innovate in automation, in simplifying our product offerings, and in particular, simplifying our optimization products for our mid-tier channels. That's where we're at with mid-tier. And then great question on attention. As we're seeing in the landscape with attention, brands are increasingly seeing attention as a key component of their media quality strategy. We were pleased to launch our quality attention post-bid beta in third quarter. It has generated a high level of interest from advertisers. We're now on track to launch the second phase of the measurement beta in fourth quarter. It includes Lumen. You might remember the partnership that we announced, Fitz, with Lumen that has an industry-leading eye-tracking technology. And a few things to call out since our attention beta launch.""}, {'url': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/80d0564f-43cb-33dd-a8ce-3cf585ccacb5/tiktok-is-bringing-logistics.html', 'title': 'TikTok Is Bringing Logistics to the ECom', 'date': '*Dated: 2023-11-08*', 'text': 'The viral video platform has put together outsourced logistics operations as it intensifies its competition for U.S. sales.'}, {'url': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6257f16c-d941-3728-b62d-addf4faac0ad/dow-jones-roars-as-palantir.html', 'title': 'Dow Jones Roars As Palantir Spikes Apple', 'date': '*Dated: 2023-11-03*', 'text': 'The market rallied strongly again Thursday, with Palantir a big winner.

The tepid outlook sent the shares down as much as 4.6% in late trading.\nWall Street had projected revenue growth of about 5% in the quarter, which is invariably Apple’s biggest sales period of the year. Revenue from the iPad and the company’s wearables category, which includes its smartwatch line, will drop significantly during the quarter, Apple said.\nThe company has been trying to pull out of its longest sales slowdown in decades. It just reported its fourth straight revenue decline, matching a streak it suffered in 2001, as the company struggles with a sluggish computer market and shaky demand in China.\nRevenue fell to $89.5 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 30. That compared with an average Wall Street estimate of $89.4 billion. Apple didn’t provide formal guidance for the current quarter, sticking with a policy it adopted during the pandemic.\nThe results suggest that Apple is facing a bigger deceleration in China than feared. The government there has imposed bans on US technology in some workplaces, and a new phone from Huawei Technologies Co. is providing fresh competition. Revenue from that region amounted to $15.1 billion last quarter, down slightly from a year earlier and well short of the $17 billion analysts had predicted.\nApple shares had closed at $177.57 in New York, leaving them up 37% this year.\nThe company updated the iPhone, its flagship product, during the fourth quarter. The period included a little over a week of sales data following the device’s launch on Sept. 22. The Cupertino, California-based company also released new watch models — the Series 9 and Ultra 2 — and updated its AirPods Pro to add a USB-C port.\nEven with the challenges, the iPhone performed slightly better than projected. It generated $43.8 billion in sales, compared with an average estimate of $43.7 billion. And the device reached a quarterly revenue record in mainland China, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said during the conference call with analysts. Earnings came in at $1.46 a share last quarter, topping the $1.39 forecast.\nCook also said the company was investing “quite a bit” in generative artificial intelligence.\nThe iPhone accounts for roughly half of Apple’s sales, so the launch of a new model is closely watched by investors. With the iPhone 15, the company redesigned the high-end versions — giving them titanium cases — and added features such as a more powerful zoom camera lens. The hope was to entice smartphone shoppers who had been holding onto their old models for longer these days.\nApple had a favorable year-over-year comparison this cycle because 2022’s iPhone 14 Pro models faced supply constraints due to shutdowns at Apple’s manufacturing partners in China. The iPhone 15 Pro had no such limitations.\nThursday’s report follows an upbeat view from Qualcomm Inc., the leading maker of smartphone chips.

The sentiment of Google based on the latest news is mixed. While Google is making progress in incorporating AI into its search engine, there are concerns about the dominance of large language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Additionally, there is a growing belief that these models can solve any problem, but the reality is that incorporating machine learning into existing tech like Google's is a journey rather than something that happened overnight.",16.81834650039673,,"[{'url': '', 'title': 'Google Walks Tightrope on AI in Search A', 'date': '*Dated: 2023-11-03*', 'text': 'Since then, the company has integrated a number of these algorithms into its search engine to help it better understand the context of user queries. Those algorithms rely on much less user data, sometimes not even needing search data at all, Nayak said. And Google keeps strict control over how they are used in search.\n“We don’t turn over the ranking as a whole to these large models,” Nayak said. “It’s risky for Google — or for anyone else, for that matter – to turn over everything to a system like these deep learning systems.”\nThe benefits to Google’s search product are clear in the results, the executives said. The search engine can now detect when a user is suicidal and recommend helplines, Nayak said.\nOr take a search query for a “vacuum cleaner for a small apartment with pets.”\nTo figure out whether the user wants information about an apartment, a vacuum cleaner or a pet requires a machine learning algorithm that can parse context, said Raghavan, the Google senior vice president and Nayak’s boss.\nEven while talking about AI updates to search, executives were careful to push back on the idea that large language models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the one Microsoft backs, are the future. The argument diverges from testimony by others in the case, such as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who said earlier this month that Google’s dominance in search gives it a leg up in the AI race.\nMicrosoft integrated a cousin of ChatGPT into its flagship search engine, Bing, in February.

The sentiment of Google based on the latest news is mixed. While Google is making progress in incorporating AI into its search engine, there are concerns about the dominance of large language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Those agreements prevented rivals like Microsoft and DuckDuckGo from gaining enough data to effectively compete, since Google gets 16 times as much data as its next closest competitor, the Justice Department said.\nGoogle officially began its defense last week after six weeks of trial in which the Justice Department and state attorneys general presented evidence. A key disagreement of the case has been over a search engine’s “scale,” a term that refers to the amount of data it collects from websites and users. The Justice Department and executives from rivals have argued that a search engine needs scale to effectively compete against Google.\nYet Google argues that its search engine is better not because of its data advantage, but because it has made more meaningful investments in people and technology. Today, user input is less important to a search engine, the company says, because of newer technologies like machine learning and large language models, which are built on a body of existing data.\nGoogle also said it hasn’t held back on all AI in search. For years, Google declined to use AI in its search engine, believing that people should build and understand its ranking systems, Pandu Nayak, Google’s top search quality executive, testified this month. But that changed in 2015, when Google decided to begin incorporating new machine learning technologies, he said.\nSince then, the company has integrated a number of these algorithms into its search engine to help it better understand the context of user queries. Those algorithms rely on much less user data, sometimes not even needing search data at all, Nayak said. And Google keeps strict control over how they are used in search.'}, {'url': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-walks-tightrope-ai-search-100000986.html', 'title': 'Google Walks Tightrope on AI in Search A', 'date': '*Dated: 2023-11-03*', 'text': '(Bloomberg) -- Google executives downplayed the company’s artificial intelligence position during testimony at a landmark federal antitrust trial, saying the Alphabet Inc. company has tried to be slow and cautious because of the dangerous power of the technology.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nImmigrants Are Leaving Canada at Faster Pace, Study Shows\nIntuit Is Closing Personal-Finance App Mint, Shifts Users to Credit Karma\nS&P 500 Set for Biggest Gain Since May Before Jobs: Markets Wrap\nJamie Dimon Warns Texas to Stop Pushing Anti-Business Laws\nIsrael Latest: Troops Encircle Gaza City as Death Toll Climbs\nThe Department of Justice has a different theory: That Google was way ahead in generative AI and chose not to release the technology sooner for fear of losing its monopoly in search.
