2023-12-01 23:06:43.619267,Asses AAPL's latest performance,"

Taking a step back, as we close our 2023 fiscal year, our annual revenue was \$383 billion. While it was down 3% from the prior year, it grew on a constant-currency basis despite the volatile and uneven macroeconomic environment. Our year-over-year revenue performance improved each quarter as we went through the year, and so did our earnings per share performance, as we reported double-digit EPS growth in the September quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in emerging markets with revenue reaching an all-time record in fiscal 2023 and double-digit growth in constant currency. We are expanding our direct presence in these markets from new Apple retail stores in India to online stores in Vietnam and Chile. And we continue to work with our partners to offer a wide range of affordability programs so that we can best serve our customers. We're very excited about the momentum we have in these markets and the opportunity ahead of us. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call.
The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Also, on foreign exchange, we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of about 1 percentage point. As a reminder, the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks. For clarity, revenue from the extra week last year added approximately 7 percentage points to the quarter's total revenue. Despite having one less week this year, we expect our December quarter, total company revenue to be similar to last year. We expect iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last year's supply disruptions and the one extra week.
We expect Mac year-over-year performance to significantly accelerate from the September quarter. We expect the year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. On iPad, we launched a new iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation during the December quarter a year ago. For the Wearable category, last year we had the full December quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd Generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. For our Services business, we expect the average revenue per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 45% and 46%.
We expect OpEx to be between \$14.4 billion and \$14.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative \$200 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax-rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of \$0.24 per share of common stock, payable on November 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?

This company, which is in the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.\nThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 23.83%.\nFor the last reported quarter, Nvidia came out with earnings of $2.70 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share, representing a surprise of 29.19%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.09 per share, delivering a surprise of 18.48%.\nFor Nvidia, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nNvidia currently has an Earnings ESP of +6.93%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 21, 2023.\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

These are assets that have long reserve lives, high grades, low cost, consistent performance and significant exploration potential, which allows you to have this performance over time. And I'll suggest to you that Greens Creek checks all five of those boxes; long reserve lives, high grade, low cost, consistent performance and significant exploration potential. Lucky Friday at this point, checks four of the five. Casa and Keno checks three of them, but all the mines check the long lives. So we are focusing on setting up the mines for the long-term, pushing for continuous improvement and allowing innovation to fundamentally improve them. So they all end up, I'm convinced all of them will end up checking all five of the boxes.\nSo with that context for the quarter, let me move to Slide 4, and I'll start with the Lucky Friday, which will not have production until early 2024 as we block off the lower part of the two shaft and build a new secondary escapeway of ventilation raise. And this three month project is going well. At the same time, we are still advancing other projects and completing our equipment purchases. We actually have 10 pieces of equipment on surface that are ready to go underground. And we expect to ramp back up to full production in Q1 and see the Lucky Friday continue in 2024, the production growth and the free cash flow that we saw before the fire. Now at Keno Hill, production has been slowed due to the delay in the shotcrete plant commissioning just yesterday in the cement rockfill plant scheduled to be completed later this month.\nTheir completion puts us in a position to advance development and production faster. And the grade of the ore has even been better than what our block model had predicted. However, we are concerned with the safety culture at Keno. Our all-injury frequency rate at Keno is around four, which is not acceptable. If you look at Greens Creek and Lucky Friday, they are both less than one. In the last two months and more recently in the last two weeks, we've had some near misses that didn't result in an injury or damage to equipment that they could have, and that's not acceptable to us. As a result, I've tasked Carlos and his team to methodically review all our process and procedures to get safety right because we know that excellent safety not only prevents injury, but also standardizes activities which increases predictability and production.\nAnd so the safety review of Keno will likely be to changes in our processes, schedules, equipment, and the way we mine. And to make the mine safer, we will re-engineer certain processes. With the mine just starting up and with its expected long mine life, we must get off on the right foot on safety. So we are going to take whatever time is needed to do that. Greens Creek had another consistent strong operational quarter and we are increasing silver production guidance at the mine. Greens Creek has already generated over a $100 million of free cash flow for the year. Now Casa Berardi had a very good quarter progressing on the transition that we are making for becoming only an open pit mine, reporting cash costs and all-in sustaining costs that are well within guidance and building infrastructure that sets the mine up for success in the next decade.\nEarlier this year, we saw the need to make the fundamental changes, which we began implementing just this past quarter, and we are already seeing the benefits of that.""}]",mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,

Additionally, Tesla's stock has been experiencing a decline over the past two weeks due to concerns about weakening demand for electric cars. Several global automakers and Wall Street analysts have expressed grim commentary about the EV industry, which has weighed on Tesla's stock. The decline in Tesla's stock price has erased about \$130 billion from the company's market capitalization. However, there was a brief rebound in the stock price after Tesla convinced a jury that its Autopilot technology was not responsible for a fatal crash.

That was followed by grim commentary from several global automakers, as well as Wall Street analysts. This week, battery-maker Panasonic Holdings Corp. and chipmaker ON Semiconductor Corp. also sounded alarms for the EV industry.\nThe warnings have weighed on stocks across the US automotive sector, which has also been battling extensive negotiations with its labor unions over wages. Still, Tesla’s decline stands out: shares have sunk over 17% since the Oct. 18 report, compared to a 2.8% drop in the S&P 500 Index, and a 3.4% decline in the Nasdaq 100. The retreat in the EV-maker’s stock price has erased about $130 billion from the company’s market capitalization.\n“At the crux of the problem is a capital-intensive sector investing in unproven EV strategies amid a world of rising costs, lower prices, rising rates and slower demand,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note discussing the wider industry weakness Tuesday. “What investors seem to be waking up to today is the idea that the tens of billions of dollars invested in EVs may be value destructive rather than value accretive.”\nThe outlook for autos overall has been darkening as high interest rates have sent the cost to own a car soaring. When coupled with rising inflation, consumers’ ability to afford big purchases has been squeezed. EVs, still a relatively new technology with an underdeveloped charging ecosystem, are getting hit first.\nAs a pureplay EV maker with an eye-watering valuation, the stakes are high for Tesla. While some part of its expensive share price reflects its potential to develop self-driving cars, a large part depends on the company’s ability to maintain its current dominant position in the EV industry and its profit margins.\nAs EV demand tapers and Tesla’s aggressive price cuts seem to be losing their ability to boost demand much further, investors are starting to get jittery, reflected in the sharp slide in the share price.\nStill, the stock staged a sharp rebound around midday in New York after the company convinced a jury that its Autopilot technology wasn’t responsible for a crash that killed a California driver four years ago.

In classrooms around the world, it's helping educators bring lessons to life, while giving students a window into the world around them.\nAnd in artist workshops, design studios and everywhere else, creative minds come together, iPad supercharges the creative process, helping users take their ideas farther than they ever could before.

We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in August, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 22 million shares.

Few doubt that AI tools like ChatGPT will make some jobs obsolete, but opinions vary widely on what the overall impact will be in the long run—even among two of the emergent tech space’s billionaire visionaries.\nIn recent days, Tesla CEO (and OpenAI cofounder) Elon Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang couldn’t have expressed more different visions for the future of the economy, once AI reaches its full potential.\nThe two have known each other for years. Huang (net worth: $38.7 billion) is a Tesla customer and interviewed Musk (net worth: $208 billion) onstage at an 2015 Nvidia event, raving about Musk’s accomplishments with electric vehicles. But since AI exploded onto the scene this year, Nvidia has gained a new prominence thanks to booming demand for its AI chips. Its market cap now exceeds $1 trillion, catapulting over Tesla, which currently sits at $690 billion.\nMusk said in Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call that he has “tremendous respect for Jensen and Nvidia” and that his carmaker is “using a lot of Nvidia hardware,” adding, “We’ll actually take Nvidia hardware as fast as Nvidia will deliver it to us.”\nBut Musk’s view on AI’s potential to replace humans in jobs is decidedly darker than Huang’s.\n“There will come a point where no job is needed,” Musk said on Thursday while sharing a stage with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the UK AI Safety Summit (held fittingly at Bletchley Park, an English estate considered one of modern computing’s birthplaces due to its role in Allied code-breaking during World War II). “You can have a job if you want a job. One of the challenges in the future will be how do we find meaning in life.”\nCalling AI the “most disruptive force in history,” he said we’ll eventually “have something that’s smarter than the smartest human.”\nA few weeks earlier, though, Huang shared his more upbeat outlook about AI in an interview with the Acquired podcast.\n“My sense is that it’s likely to generate jobs,” he said. “The first thing that happens with productivity is prosperity. When the companies get more successful, they hire more people, because they want to expand into more areas.”\nA common line of thinking, he noted, is that if a company improves productivity with AI, then it will employ fewer people. But that assumes a company will have no new ideas, he said, and “that's not true for most companies.”\nSo long as there are more areas to expand into—new ideas in transportation, retail, entertainment, technology, and drug discovery—the prosperity that comes from improved productivity results in more people being hired, he believes. He noted that today’s industries are larger than those of a thousand years ago “because obviously humans have a lot of ideas.”\nHuang does think some people will lose their job due to artificial intelligence, but argues they’ll more likely lose it to another human using AI. “I think jobs will change,” he said, but “my guess is that we’ll actually have higher employment, we’ll create more jobs.”\nThe difference may stem from how Musk seems in general to have a harsher view of employees than Huang does. Another area where they completely disagree is remote work. While Musk has railed against it—suggesting that remote workers “pretend to work”—Huang has no problem with it whatsoever, telling VentureBeat in 2020 that however employees choose mix their work settings, “I’m perfectly comfortable with all that.”\nNvidia has stuck with its remote-work policy; meanwhile, an increasing number of high-profile CEOs have embraced Musk’s line of thinking and issued return-to-office mandates.\nAnd while Musk ruthlessly slashed 80% of the workforce at Twitter after acquiring the company late last year, at one point mocking a fired employee with a disability before backpedaling—he soon faced a flurry of lawsuits and other legal actions over benefits owed and the manner of the terminations—Nvidia avoided the large layoffs seen elsewhere in the tech industry.""}]",mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,

But in February 2019, testimony at the antitrust trial revealed Tuesday, Google internally declared a “Code Yellow” amid concerns the company might not meet its goals for search revenue for the quarter.\nAs part of the emergency, which lasted for seven weeks, engineers from Google’s search and Chrome browser teams were reassigned to figure out why user queries had slowed, according to the documents.\nBen Gomes, Google’s former head of search, was called by the company in its defense to show that it had made various advancements in search, particularly in mobile. However, cross examination by Justice Department lawyer David Dahlquist revealed the tensions between Gomes’ search team and its advertising counterparts.\nThe questioning sought to undermine Google’s contentions that its search team focuses solely on improving the user experience and has sometimes been pulled into the advertising side, where the Justice Department alleges Google has been able to raise prices without pushback.\nThe trial, now in its eighth week, focuses on whether Google has illegally maintained its monopoly by spending billions of dollars to stifle competition and preserve its monopoly over online search.\nEarlier: Google’s Pichai Refutes DOJ Allegations of Deleting Evidence\nIn a statement, Google pushed back on the idea that search results and innovation were affected by the company’s ad revenue goals. “The organic results you see in search are not affected by our ads systems or by the ads we show for a query,” said Peter Schottenfels, a Google spokesperson.\nGoogle argues that it has captured about 90% of the market for search on the merits of a superior product, and that its advancements in internet search have benefited the public. But emails revealed in court on Tuesday showed that there was some concern among key members of the company’s search team that Google was focused on growth over innovation.\nIn a 2019 email, Gomes wrote to other executives that his search team was “getting too close to the money.”\nEmails as Evidence\n“I think it is good for us to aspire to query growth and to aspire to more users. But I think we are getting too involved with ads for the good of the product and company,” Gomes wrote.\n“I am getting concerned that growth is all we are thinking about,” he ended the email.\nQuery growth is measured by looking at the number of user queries, which the Justice Department argued can translate to increased revenue, since greater queries provide more opportunities for Google to run search ads against them.\nGomes testified in court that he was feeling frustrated and sent the email at 6 a.m. At the time, Google set its metrics on the number of user queries, which Gomes said he believed wasn’t a good one since product improvements should help users find answers quickly.\n“I did not care for queries as a metric,” he said. “I think this metric of just using queries is not one that optimizes appropriately.”\nGoogle ended the “Code Yellow” emergency in mid-March. Prabhakar Raghavan, then head of Google’s advertising, wrote to Gomes at the time, praising the “heroic” engineering that resolved the issue.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Alphabet\'s  ROE.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company\'s management is utilizing the company\'s capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nThe formula for return on equity is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders\' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is:\n24% = US$67b ÷ US$273b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\nThe \'return\' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders\' capital it has, the company made $0.24 in profit.\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\nTo begin with, Alphabet has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 7.2% the company\'s ROE is quite impressive. So, the substantial 20% net income growth seen by Alphabet over the past five years isn\'t overly surprising.\nWe then compared Alphabet\'s net income growth with the industry and we\'re pleased to see that the company\'s growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 5.3% in the same 5-year period.\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for GOOGL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. \nAlphabet doesn\'t pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what\'s driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Alphabet\'s performance. In particular, it\'s great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company\'s fundamentals?

The sentiment on Google based on recent news is mixed. On one hand, Google is expanding its generative AI-powered search platform, Search Generative Experience, to more than 100 countries and territories and adding support for four new languages. On the other hand, Google is also facing antitrust investigations in multiple countries, including the US, UK, and EU, over its dominance in search and other online services.

SGE serves as a generative AI-powered version of Google Search, while Bard is a generative AI-powered chatbot. You can ask them both questions, but SGE is focused primarily on providing answers to search queries.\nAs part of Wednesday’s announcement, Google’s senior director of product management and search, Hema Budaraju, said SGE is expanding to 126 new regions including Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, and South Korea.\nThe company now offers SGE in\xa0a total of\xa0129 countries and territories. Users can also now search using Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, and Indonesian.\nIn addition to expanding and incorporating more languages, Budaraju said SGE users will now be able to ask follow-up questions to prior queries directly from the main results page. Users will continue to see their answers to prior questions and, importantly for Google, relevant ads on the same page.\nAccording to Budaraju, the new feature will roll out in the coming weeks in the US and will only be available in English.\nFinally, Google announced that it’s improving SGE’s translation capabilities. The company says it will now detect if you’re trying to translate a statement using a homonym and ask which version of the word you want to use. Homonyms are two or more words that have the same spelling but different meanings.\nBudaraju used the example of translating a sentence from English to Spanish with the word “tie” in it. You’ll then be able to tap the “tie” and choose the specific meaning you want to get across.\nSGE is Google’s answer to Microsoft’s generative AI-powered Bing search engine. Microsoft got the drop on Google in February when it debuted its Bing platform along with its own chatbot. Google responded months later with the debut of SGE and a public presentation of its Bard bot.\nGenerative AI has the potential to dramatically improve online search, providing users with a more personalized experience, but the technology presents some unique problems.\nGenerative AI results aren’t always accurate, which can impact user trust in search engine responses. Advertisers and ad sellers like Google also rely on search result real estate to sell ads. AI-generated responses, however, take up a large amount of screen space. Google is working to find a balance that allows for ads and results without diminishing the quality of either.\n“People are finding ads helpful here, as they provide useful options to take action and connect with businesses. We’ll experiment with new formats native to SGE that use generative AI to create relevant, high-quality ads, customized to every step of the search journey,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said during the company’s recent earnings call.\nMicrosoft is already touting gains from its Bing search engine and Edge browser. During the company's latest earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella said users had more than 1.9 billion chats with Bing and that Edge has gained share in the browser market for 10 consecutive quarters.\nIt'll take quite a while for Bing or Edge to catch up with Google, the world's leading search engine, but the company is banking on generative AI to do just that.\nSGE is still in its early stages, but the company is widely expected to evolve the platform over time before ultimately making it a new primary search option for web users.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

And Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Hartnett says technical factors no longer stand in the way of a year-end rally in stocks.\nThe bank’s in-house sentiment gauge, the Bull & Bear Indicator, is flashing a contrarian buy signal for a third straight week amid poor equity market breadth — a reference to the number of stocks rising — and large outflows from high-yield and emerging-market bonds, the strategist wrote in a note. The indicator has slid to 1.4, below the 2 level that BofA says implies a buy signal.\nMeantime, BofA’s Savita Subramanian says the S&P 500 offers a better entry point now relative to its July peak — and “the probability of a positive surprise in higher beta stocks is high,” while noting that the frequency of clients asking whether they should wait to buy equities has increased.\n“Extreme fear can be just as costly as greed,” she wrote.\nWhile the stock market has enjoyed a powerful rebound this week, lurking beneath the euphoric surface are still fears about Corporate America’s profit outlook.\nAmong companies that have issued guidance this earnings season for next quarter and beyond, more have been providing estimates that trail analysts’ expectations. A gauge of forward guidance that compares corporate forecasts with the Wall Street consensus has been lower only once since 2019, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.\n‘Manic Dispersion’\nThe litany of bullish calls for both the stock and bond markets that have been resounding should be an obvious signal that investor sentiment (at best) remains neutral and (at worst) will quickly revert back toward bullish extremes, according to Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott.\n“Such manic dispersion in outlook implies that the markets may likely need more time to find their footing, and could even see lower levels over the coming months,” he noted. “Our work points to more volatility ahead.”\nMeantime, bonds are looking attractive and set to beat cash over the next year as inflation cools and central banks end policy tightening, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s head of asset allocation strategy.\n“Bonds are starting to offer an attractive entry point,” said Christian Mueller-Glissmann. “Central banks are very close or already at the end of their rate-hiking cycle. We also recognize the pressure that comes from rising long-dated bond yields on the economy. Those factors set investors up nicely for a much better starting point for buying bonds.”\nCorporate Highlights:\nApple Inc., which is trying to reverse several successive quarters of revenue decline, reported its lowest revenue from the greater China region since mid-2022.\nThe US threw its support behind JetBlue Airways Corp.’s attempt to fight expulsion from Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport.\nCarvana Co. beat Wall Street’s expectations in the third quarter, defying the challenges posed by rising interest rates and high inflation.\nFortinet Inc. cut its annual guidance a second time and projecting that fourth-quarter billings and revenue will fall short of expectations.\nCoinbase Global Inc.’s revenue increased more than forecast as the largest US crypto exchange sought to weather an industrywide decline in trading activity.\nDraftKings Inc., the online sportsbook, reported third-quarter sales and monthly unique players that beat consensus estimates.\nBooking Holdings Inc. said travel demand had been diminished by the Israel-Hamas war, even while forecasting growth and reporting earnings that beat expectations.\nThe company has greater exposure in Europe and the Middle East than rivals such as Expedia Group Inc.\nBlock Inc., the payments giant run by Jack Dorsey, again boosted its forecast for adjusted profit for the year as customers increasingly turn to its popular Cash App.\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is poised to show that persistently high interest rates have helped the conglomerate more than they hindered it.'}, {'url': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b30501d8-c05b-3aac-b079-7d76806acc84/these-stocks-moved-the-most.html', 'title': 'These Stocks Moved the Most Today Apple ', 'date': '*Dated: 2023-11-04*', 'text': 'Apple’s forecast for the holiday quarter disappointed, Block stock surged on strong guidance, and Bill Holdings and Fortinet slumped after weak outlooks.'}]",mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,

Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported its financial results for the September quarter of 2023. The company's revenue for the quarter was \$89.5 billion, down less than 1% from the same quarter a year ago. However, on a constant-currency basis, the company's revenue grew year-over-year in total and in each geographic segment. The company's gross margin for the quarter was 45.2%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. The company's services revenue set an all-time record of \$22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year, with growth accelerating sequentially from the June quarter. The company's operating expenses were at the low end of the guidance range provided, up 2% year-over-year. The company's net income was \$23 billion, diluted earnings per share was \$1.46, up 13% versus last year and a September quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at \$21.6 billion.",23.200757026672363,"[{'url': '', 'title': 'Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL Q4 2023 Earnings Ca', 'date': '*Dated: 2023-11-05*', 'text': 'Our total installed-base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and many new customers joining our ecosystem.

Our performance in Services were broad based, as we reached all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific and a September quarter record in Greater China. We also set new records in every Services category. Company gross margin set a September quarter record at 45.2%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange.\nProducts gross margin was 36.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.9%, up 40 basis points from last quarter due to a different mix.

We continue to see extremely high levels of customer satisfaction which 451 Research recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year, driven by challenging market conditions and compounded by a difficult compare in our own business, whereby last year we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter and were subsequently able to fulfill significant pent-up demand during the September quarter. We also had a difference in launch timing with the MacBook Air launching earlier this year in the June quarter compared to the September quarter last year. We have great confidence in our Mac lineup and are excited about the recently announced iMac and MacBook Pro powered by our M3 chips.\nOur installed base is at an all-time high and half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product, driven by MacBook Air. Also, we saw reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad generated $6.4 billion in revenue, down 10% year-over-year. Similar to Mac, these results were a function of a difficult compare from the supply disruptions in the June quarter a year ago and the subsequent fulfillment of pent-up demand in the September quarter. iPad continues to attract a large number of new customers to the installed base with over half of the customers who purchase iPads during the quarter being new to the product and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3% year-over-year.\nWe had a September quarter record in Europe and we saw strong performance in several emerging markets around the world.'}, {'url': '', 'title': 'Apple Warns of Sluggish Holiday Quarter ', 'date': '*Dated: 2023-11-03*', 'text': 'What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n“The sales miss in China is discouraging and could have been caused by soft consumer spending.”\n— Anurag Rana, BI technology industry analyst\nClick here to read his research.\nIn one potentially ominous sign, Qualcomm said that its smartphone chip business saw a 35% increase from Chinese phone makers, suggesting that customers in the region are opting for non-iPhones in larger numbers.

It did, however, release a cheaper Apple Pencil stylus for its tablets this week.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe US Housing Market Has Become an Impossible Mess\nWorld’s Safest Market Becomes a Magnet for Big Investors\nThese Five Countries Are Key Economic ‘Connectors’ in a Fragmenting World\nFoxconn Makes Your iPhone.

Also, on foreign exchange, we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of about 1 percentage point. As a reminder, the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks. For clarity, revenue from the extra week last year added approximately 7 percentage points to the quarter's total revenue. Despite having one less week this year, we expect our December quarter, total company revenue to be similar to last year. We expect iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last year's supply disruptions and the one extra week.\nWe expect Mac year-over-year performance to significantly accelerate from the September quarter. We expect the year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. On iPad, we launched a new iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation during the December quarter a year ago. For the Wearable category, last year we had the full December quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd Generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. For our Services business, we expect the average revenue per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 45% and 46%.\nWe expect OpEx to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $200 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax-rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock, payable on November 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions.

Both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double-digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high. Also our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, nearly double the number we had only three years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from exciting new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to additional storage tiers on iCloud. We believe our customers will love this new offering. Turning to enterprise. We are excited to see our business customers in both developed and emerging markets expand their deployment of Apple products and technologies to drive business innovation and employee satisfaction.\nStarbucks continuously invest in Apple technology to bring the best experience to the customers and employees, including tens of thousands of iPads across all retail stores to help their teams streamline order management, operations and training. In addition, Starbucks recently refreshed over 10,000 Macs to the latest M2-powered MacBook Air for all store managers, enabling them to do their best work and improve productivity. And in Indonesia, popular technology company GoTo is offering Mac as a choice, so that employees can have the best tools to be most productive. Today, more than half of its workforce are already choosing Mac for work. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $162 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nWe increased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $51 billion at the end of the quarter. And our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $15.5 billion through open market repurchases of 85 million Apple shares. We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in August, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 22 million shares. Taking a step back, as we close our 2023 fiscal year, our annual revenue was $383 billion. While it was down 3% from the prior year, it grew on a constant-currency basis despite the volatile and uneven macroeconomic environment.\nOur year-over-year revenue performance improved each quarter as we went through the year, and so did our earnings per share performance, as we reported double-digit EPS growth in the September quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in emerging markets with revenue reaching an all-time record in fiscal 2023 and double-digit growth in constant currency. We are expanding our direct presence in these markets from new Apple retail stores in India to online stores in Vietnam and Chile. And we continue to work with our partners to offer a wide range of affordability programs so that we can best serve our customers. We're very excited about the momentum we have in these markets and the opportunity ahead of us.""}]",mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1,
