title:AMD_Stock_Surges_9_on_Upbeat_Q3_Earnings_ETFs_to_Benefit
Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices AMD reported third-quarter 2023 non-GAAP earnings of 70 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.94% and climbing 4.5% year over year. Revenues of $5.8 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.65% and increased 4.2% year over year. However, the guidance was unimpressive. The company expects weakness in the Gaming and Embedded segment to hurt revenues in the current quarter.
Data Center revenues declined 0.7% year over year to $1.6 billion and accounted for 27.6% of total revenues. Sequentially, revenues increased 21%, driven by strong adoption of fourth-generation AMD EPYC CPUs. Our model estimate for third-quarter Data Center revenues was pegged at $1.62 billion.
The Client segment revenues increased 42.2% year over year to $1.46 billion and accounted for 25.1% of total revenues. Higher Ryzen mobile processor sales drove top-line growth. Our model estimate for third-quarter Client revenues was pegged at $1.24 billion.
The Gaming segment revenues decreased 7.7% year over year to $1.51 billion and accounted for 26% of total revenues. The decline was primarily attributed to lower semi-custom revenues. Our model estimate for third-quarter Gaming revenues was pegged at $1.61 billion.
The Embedded segment revenues were $1.24 billion, down 4.6% year over year. The segment accounted for 21.4% of total revenues. The top line suffered from lower performance in the communications market. Our model estimate for third-quarter Embedded revenues was pegged at $1.23 billion.
AMD expects fourth-quarter 2023 revenues to be $6.1 billion (+/-$300 million), which indicates year-over-year growth of 9% and 5% sequentially at the mid-point.
It expects to witness year-over-year growth in the Data Center and Client segments by double-digit percentage. The Gaming segment is expected to decline due to the matured console cycle. Softness in the embedded market will likely hurt Embedded revenues.
Sequentially, Data Center segment revenues are expected to grow on a double-digit percentage, while Client is expected to increase. However, Gaming and Embedded segment revenues are expected to decline by a double-digit percentage.
