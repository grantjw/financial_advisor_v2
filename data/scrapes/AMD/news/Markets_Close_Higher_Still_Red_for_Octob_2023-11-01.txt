A decent Q3 earnings season in its early stages and a somewhat oversold market from July yearly highs are other factors. High bond yield rates have done a bit of the Fed’s work for them, with the 10-year at 4.911% today and the 2-year 5.071%. We’re back to below 20 basis points (bps) on this yield curve, as well.Earlier today, Case-Shiller Home Prices for August grew +2.2%, better than the +1.6% expected. This is the biggest monthly growth in home prices since January of this year, and is actually counter to what the Fed wants to see on this important inflation metric.

Chicago and New York grew the strongest, both +5% for the month.Advanced Micro Devices AMD shares are selling off nearly -5% following its Q3 earnings report out after the closing bell today.
