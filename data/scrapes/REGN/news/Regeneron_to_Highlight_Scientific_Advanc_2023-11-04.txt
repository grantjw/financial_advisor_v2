title:Regeneron_to_Highlight_Scientific_Advancements_Across_Diversified_Pipeline_in_DifficulttoTreat_Blood_Cancers_and_Disorders_at_ASH
Ten abstracts, including three oral presentations, spotlight the expanding body of evidence supporting odronextamab in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
Additional presentations include the first review of primary endpoint results with longer follow-up from the pivotal trial for linvoseltamab in heavily pre-treated patients with multiple myeloma
TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Nov. 03, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced that new and updated data from its hematology pipeline will be shared in 19 abstracts at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting from December 9 to 12 in San Diego, CA. These include research across six investigational medicines that span eight difficult-to-treat blood cancers and disorders. Together, these presentations showcase the diversity of approaches Regeneron is advancing through its hematology pipeline and its dedication to leading-edge research.
“We are fusing our legacy of innovation with our deep scientific expertise in hematology to advance research across multiple modalities as we aim to ultimately make a meaningful impact in patients’ lives. Our data at ASH are a testament to our progress towards this ambition,” said L. Andres Sirulnik, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Sciences, Hematology at Regeneron. “In addition to new results from our pivotal trials evaluating odronextamab and linvoseltamab, we are presenting findings on our growing blood disorders pipeline. Further, our presentations span emerging measures of disease that contribute to a deeper understanding of these advanced conditions, which in the future could form the basis of response-directed treatment paradigms.”
At ASH, 10 abstracts will feature updated data and analyses for Regeneron’s most advanced investigational blood cancer medicine, odronextamab (CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody), in relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) and R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Among them are three oral presentations from its pivotal trial (ELM-2), including: the final analysis in R/R DLBCL patients; a comprehensive analysis of minimal residual disease status and circulating tumor DNA profiling in R/R FL and DLBCL patients; and updated analyses and long-term follow-up of efficacy, safety and patient reported outcomes in R/R FL. Furthermore, the company will share long-term survival outcomes and a responder analysis for odronextamab from a Phase 1 trial (ELM-1) in R/R DLBCL patients who have progressed after CAR-T therapy, a patient population who have a particularly dismal prognosis and limited effective treatment options. Odronextamab is currently under regulatory review for the treatment of R/R FL and R/R DLBCL by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with a target action date of March 31, 2024, as well as by the European Medicines Agency.
Five presentations will highlight data supporting linvoseltamab (BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody), including the first presentation of primary endpoint results with longer follow-up from the pivotal Phase 2 trial (LINKER-MM1) in heavily pre-treated patients with multiple myeloma. Additionally, two presentations will review the latest results from three Phase 2 studies evaluating pozelimab (C5 antibody) in combination with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s cemdisiran (siRNA C5 inhibitor) in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disorder.

About Regeneron in HematologyAt Regeneron, we’re applying more than three decades of biology expertise with our proprietary VelociSuite® technologies to develop medicines for patients with diverse blood cancers and rare blood disorders.
Our blood cancer research is focused on bispecific antibodies that are being investigated both as monotherapies and in combination with each other and emerging therapeutic modalities. Together, they provide us with unique combinatorial flexibility to develop customized and potentially synergistic cancer treatments.
Our research and collaborations to develop potential treatments for rare blood disorders include explorations in antibody medicine, gene editing and gene-knockout technologies, and investigational RNA-approaches focused on depleting abnormal proteins or blocking disease-causing cellular signaling.
