Accounting automation software maker Blackline (NASDAQ:BL) will be reporting earnings tomorrow after market close. Here's what investors should know.
Last quarter BlackLine reported revenues of $144.6 million, up 12.5% year on year, in line with analyst expectations. It was a slower quarter for the company, with full-year revenue guidance missing analysts' expectations and underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter. In addition, revenue retention rate has been declining, and user growth has been slowing down. The company added 43 customers to a total of 4,279.

BlackLine is down 6.94% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with analyst price target of $58.9, compared to share price of $49.1.
One way to find opportunities in the market is to watch for generational shifts in the economy. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks and as a result, the demand for cloud-native cybersecurity is skyrocketing. This company is leading a massive technological shift in the industry  and with revenue growth of 70% year on year and best-in-class SaaS metrics it should definitely be on your radar.
