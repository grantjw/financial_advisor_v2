"Over the past year and a half, we’ve seen a stabilization of the growth of both small business jobs and wages, in line with macroeconomic trends," said John Gibson, Paychex president and CEO. "Following a long period of wage inflation, we are seeing that trend begin to cool, as the supply and demand for workers appears to be coming back into balance."
"The small business employment and wage trends we’re seeing at a national level can be largely attributed to changes taking place in individual industry sectors," added Frank Fiorille, Paychex vice president of risk, compliance, and data analytics. "For instance, in Leisure and Hospitality, hourly earnings growth is declining and fell below four percent for the first time since 2021."
In further detail, the October 2023 report shows:
The rate of small business job growth has slowed 0.66% from a year ago to 98.77 but remains above pre-pandemic (2019) levels.

Leisure and Hospitality hourly earnings growth slowed below four percent (3.93%) for the first time since February 2021.
The South leads regional small business job growth for the 19th consecutive month. At 4.10%, the West tops regional hourly earnings growth for the fifth-straight month.
At 100.66, North Carolina has led the pace of small business job growth among states for the 15th of the past 16 months. Meanwhile, Michigan and Ohio are the two weakest states for job growth in October.
