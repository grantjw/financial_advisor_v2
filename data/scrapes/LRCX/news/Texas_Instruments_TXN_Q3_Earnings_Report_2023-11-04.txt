Technology stocks have been hit hard by fears of higher interest rates and while some of the semiconductors stocks have fared somewhat better, they have not been spared, with share price declining 5.43% over the last month. Texas Instruments is down 7.68% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with analysts' average price target of $181.1, compared to share price of $148.6.
One way to find opportunities in the market is to watch for generational shifts in the economy. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks and as a result, the demand for cloud-native cybersecurity is skyrocketing. This company is leading a massive technological shift in the industry  and with revenue growth of 70% year on year and best-in-class SaaS metrics it should definitely be on your radar.
