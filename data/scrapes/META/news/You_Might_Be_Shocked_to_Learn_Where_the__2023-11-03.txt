The benchmark S&P 500 index has delivered a return of about 8.5% so far in 2023. The term was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe seven of America's top technology giants, which currently make up almost 28% of the index's value. The other 493 companies in the S&P 500 -- which make up the remaining 72% of its value -- are actually weighing it down in 2023.
