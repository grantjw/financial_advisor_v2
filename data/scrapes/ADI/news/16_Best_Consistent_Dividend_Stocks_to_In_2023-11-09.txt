According to a recent report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, in the third quarter of 2023, a total of 448 dividend increases were announced by US companies, amounting to a substantial $18.0 billion in increased dividend payments. This data underscores a positive trend in the financial landscape, as a significant number of companies chose to boost their dividend payouts during this period, which can be seen as a promising indicator for investors and shareholders alike.
That said, when it comes to dividend investing, many investors tend to be overly attracted to high yields, a behavior that financial experts discourage. Although high yields can provide short-term satisfaction, the key to reaping lasting advantages from dividends is to prioritize the stability and long-term reliability of those dividend payments. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist for Morningstar Indexes, spoke about durable dividend stocks. Here are some comments from the analyst:
“It’s really critical to be selective when it comes to buying dividend-paying stocks and chasing yield. Looking for the most yield-rich areas of the market can often lead you into troubled areas and dividend traps—companies that have a nice-looking yield that is ultimately unsustainable. You have to screen for dividend durability and reliability going forward.”
Dividends can serve as a powerful indicator of a company's potential to boost its profits and cash flow in the future. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, a select group of large-cap companies, have consistently increased their dividends for at least 25 years, with many surpassing 40 years. Over time, these companies have demonstrated higher return on equity and more robust earnings growth when compared to the broader S&P 500. According to a report by ProShares, ever since its introduction, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index has consistently outperformed the broader S&P 500 index while maintaining lower levels of market volatility. This means that an initial investment of $10,000 made in May 2005 could have potentially grown to over $61,000 by March 2023. What's particularly noteworthy is that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index has managed to capture 91% of the market's upswings and 80% of its downturns, demonstrating robust performance in both bullish and bearish market conditions.

While the digital brains get a lot more media attention, the supporting analog chips are as vital as those big expensive digital processors in driving value in electronic devices, which are becoming ubiquitous and intelligent throughout our lives.
Anything with an on-off switch requires lots of these analog chips if it is going to relay input and output information with the physical world as well as manage the electrical power supply feeding the device.
