title:Analog_Semiconductors_Stocks_Q2_Teardown_Impinj_NASDAQPI_Vs_The_Rest
The end of the earnings season is always a good time to take a step back and see who shined (and who not so much). Letâ€™s take a look at how the analog semiconductors stocks have fared in Q2, starting with Impinj (NASDAQ:PI).
Demand for analog chips is generally linked to the overall level of economic growth, as analog chips serve as the building blocks of most electronic goods and equipment. Unlike digital chip designers, analog chip makers tend to produce the majority of their own chips, as analog chip production does not require expensive leading edge nodes. Less dependent on major secular growth drivers, analog product cycles are much longer, often 5-7 years.
The 15 analog semiconductors stocks we track reported a slower Q2; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 1.9% while next quarter's revenue guidance was 5.17% below consensus. Technology stocks have been hit hard by fears of higher interest rates as investors search for near-term cash flows, and analog semiconductors stocks have not been spared, with share prices down 14% on average, since the previous earnings results.
Founded by Caltech professor Carver Mead and one of his students Chris Diorio, Impinj (NASDAQ:PI) is a maker of radio-frequency identification (RFID) hardware and software.
