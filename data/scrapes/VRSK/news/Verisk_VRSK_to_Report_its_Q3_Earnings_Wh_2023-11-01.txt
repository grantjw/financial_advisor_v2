title:Verisk_VRSK_to_Report_its_Q3_Earnings_Whats_in_the_Offing
Verisk Analytics VRSK is scheduled to release its third-quarter 2023 results on Nov 1, before the bell.
The company has had an impressive earnings surprise history. It outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the four trailing quarters and matched once, delivering an earnings surprise of 9.9% on average.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line is currently pegged at $662.6 million, indicating an 11.1% decline from the year-ago actual figure. Verisk Analytics’ performance in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to have been negatively impacted by the disposition of Energy and Specialized Markets, and Financial Services segments, despite the Insurance segment remaining in good shape.

The consensus estimate for the bottom line is pegged at $1.46 per share, which matches the year-ago figure. The bottom line is expected to be unmoved even after a strong cost and operational discipline, and cost-reduction programs, the effects of which are likely to have been offset by the negative margin impact from recent acquisitions and higher Travel and Entertainment expenses.
