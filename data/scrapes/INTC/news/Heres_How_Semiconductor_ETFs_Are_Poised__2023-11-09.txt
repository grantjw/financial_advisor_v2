title:Heres_How_Semiconductor_ETFs_Are_Poised_Post_Q3_Earnings
The semiconductor space has struggled over the past three months on bets over persistently higher rates. Now, with signs of the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hiking campaign nearing an end, we are likely to see a reversal of the decline in the sector. The expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh opportunities for growth within the sector.Additionally, a spate of strong earnings reports from well-known players like Intel INTC, Texas Instruments TXN, Lam Research Corporation LRCX, Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Qualcomm QCOM instilled confidence in the sector. However, Texas Instruments TXN disappointed investors.As such, the performance of semiconductor ETFs has been good over the past month. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF SMH, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX and Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ gained 3.3%, 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively, while First Trust NASDAQ Semiconductor ETF FTXL shed just 0.04%.Let’s dig into the individual performances:
Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, beat on both the top and the bottom lines and provided an upbeat fourth-quarter revenue guidance. This underscores optimism over the company’s growth prospects. It reported earnings per share of 41 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents and increased 11% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues declined 8% year over year to $14.2 billion but came in above the estimated $13.5 billion. The better-than-expected results were driven by a recovery in the personal computers market. For the current quarter, Intel projects revenues in the range of $14.6 billion to $15.6 billion, while earnings per share are expected to be 44 cents (read: Intel Jumps on Q3 Earnings Beat, Upbeat View: ETFs to Buy).Texas Instruments reported disappointing third-quarter 2023 results, missing our earnings estimate by a penny and revenue estimate by $35 million.

Earnings per share of $6.85 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 78 cents, while revenues of $3.48 billion edged past the estimated $3.41 billion.
