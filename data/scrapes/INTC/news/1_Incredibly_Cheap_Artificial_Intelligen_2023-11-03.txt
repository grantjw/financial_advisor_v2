Artificial intelligence (AI) is having a massive impact on the semiconductor industry, and this technology is highly dependent on advanced chips with huge computational capacity that can be power-efficient at the same time. Companies have been lining up to buy powerful chips from Nvidia and its peers to train and deploy large-language models, which are the backbone of generative AI applications such as ChatGPT and Bard. The demand for AI chips is forecast to increase at a robust annual rate of 38% over the next decade, generating $384 billion in annual revenue by 2032.
