Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 were $2.254 billion, up 8.7% from net sales of $2.073 billion in the prior year's second fiscal quarter.
GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $666.6 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, up from GAAP net income of $546.2 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, in the prior year's second fiscal quarter. For the second quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, GAAP net income was adversely impacted by amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with our previous acquisitions.
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $889.3 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, up from non-GAAP net income of $814.4 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, in the prior year's second fiscal quarter. For the second quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, and losses on the settlement of debt. For the second quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the applicable fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.
Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors declared a record quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 43.9 cents per share, up 33.8% from the year ago quarter. The quarterly dividend is payable on December 6, 2023 to stockholders of record on November 22, 2023.
"Amid a turbulent macro environment, we delivered fiscal second-quarter results that were in line with our guidance," said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Revenue declined 1.5% sequentially, as all regions of the world and most end markets experienced varying degrees of weakness. This marks a turning point for an extraordinary three-year growth period for Microchip. Throughout this period, we successfully addressed supply chain challenges, invested well over a billion dollars in expanding our capacity, and boosted our investments for high-growth markets and applications, demonstrating our disciplined commitment to supply resilience and product innovation, in the pursuit of above-average long-term growth."
Mr. Moorthy added, "As our customers adjust to their evolving demand patterns, we have continued to accommodate customer pushout requests where possible. We have also made considerable progress in further decreasing average lead times and ended the September quarter at roughly 13 weeks. The reduction in lead times is resulting in lower bookings and reduced near-term visibility. The actions we are taking to reduce lead times are designed to enable our customers and us to navigate this uncertain environment with agility and effectiveness."
Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, "During the September quarter, we took measures to refinance some of our maturing debt. In light of the unpredictable interest-rate climate, we strategically utilized a blend of a new $750 million Term Loan A and our credit line to retire our $1 billion bond which matured in September 2023. We also issued $1 billion in commercial paper, which resulted in about a 90 basis point lower interest rate than the rate under our line of credit. We also retired $18.2 million of principal amount of our convertible bonds due in 2027 with a total cash payment of $42.7 million, effectively mitigating potential share count dilution. We remain focused on continuing to enhance our capital structure in the future."
Mr. Moorthy concluded, "Given the broader economic landscape characterized by decelerating economic activity and escalating business ambiguity, along with our proactive measures to assist clients in managing their inventory positions and backlog, we anticipate net sales in the December quarter to be down 15% to down 20% sequentially. Notwithstanding any near-term macro weakness, we are confident that semiconductors remain the engine of innovation for the applications and markets we serve. Our focus on Total System Solutions and key market megatrends is fueling strong design-win momentum that we expect will drive above-market long-term growth."

(1) See the "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section of this release for information regarding our non-GAAP guidance.(2) We are not able to estimate the amount of certain Special Charges and Other, net that may be incurred during the quarter ending December 31, 2023. Therefore, our estimate of GAAP operating expenses excludes certain amounts that may be recognized as Special Charges and Other, net in the quarter ending December 31, 2023.(3) The forecast for GAAP tax expense excludes any unexpected tax events that may occur during the quarter, as these amounts cannot be forecasted.(4) Represents the expected cash tax rate for fiscal 2024, excluding any transition tax payments associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Capital expenditures for the quarter ending December 31, 2023 are expected to be between $50 million and $70 million. Capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2024 are expected to be between $300 million and $325 million. We are selectively adding capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing capabilities to support the expected growth of our business.
Under the GAAP revenue recognition standard, which we adopted on April 1, 2018, we are required to recognize revenue when control of the product changes from us to a customer or distributor. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on creating demand for our products in the end markets we serve and not on moving inventory into our distribution network. We also manage our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including our distributor relationships, towards the goal of having our products available at the time and location the end customer desires.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Our non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, and losses on the settlement of debt. For the second quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units, and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. Our other non-GAAP adjustments are either non-cash expenses, unusual or infrequent items, or other expenses related to transactions. Management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.
We are using non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars, including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP other expense, net, and non-GAAP income tax rate, which exclude the items noted above, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.
Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of our business and for compensation purposes. We also use our non-GAAP results when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Our determination of these non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using these non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.
Generally, gross profit fluctuates over time, driven primarily by the mix of products sold and licensing revenue; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; costs of wafers from foundries; inventory reserves; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to net sales and profit levels.
Diluted Common Shares Outstanding can vary for, among other things, the trading price of our common stock, the exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the potential for incremental dilutive shares from our convertible debentures (additional information regarding our share count is available in the investor relations section of our website under the heading "Supplemental Financial Information"), and repurchases or issuances of shares of our common stock. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table above assumes an average Microchip stock price in the December 2023 quarter between $70 and $80 per share (however, we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period and we cannot estimate what our stock option exercise activity will be during the quarter).
