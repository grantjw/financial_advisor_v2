Inogen, Inc. INGN incurred an adjusted loss per share of 36 cents for third-quarter 2023, wider than the adjusted loss per share of 18 cents in the year-ago period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at a loss of 57 cents per share.
GAAP loss per share for the quarter was $1.97, wider than the year-earlier loss of 42 cents per share.
Inogen registered revenues of $83.9 million for the third quarter, down 20.3% year over year. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8%.
On a constant-currency basis, total revenues for the reported quarter decreased 21.5%.
Per management, the year-over-year decrease in the top line primarily resulted from lower domestic business-to-business sales and lower direct-to-consumer revenues. However, this was partially offset by strong growth in rental and international business-to-business sales.
Inogen derives revenues from two sources — rental and sales.
Rental revenues for the reported quarter grossed $15.9 million, up 8.7% from the year-ago period. Per management, an increase in the total number of rental patients on service resulted in the upside. This figure compares to our Rental revenues’ third-quarter projection of $13.1 million.
Sales revenues were $67.9 million, down 25% from the prior-year quarter. This figure compares to our Sales revenues’ third-quarter projection of $67.2 million.
Domestic business-to-business sales for third-quarter 2023 amounted to $17.3 million, down 59.4% on a year-over-year basis. Our projection for the same was $34.7 million.
International business-to-business sales for the reported quarter amounted to $25.6 million, up 69.8% year over year on a reported basis and up 62% on a constant-currency basis. Our model estimate for the metric was $15.2 million.
Domestic direct-to-consumer sales decreased 24.1% year over year to $25.1 million for the quarter. Our estimate for the same was $17.3 million.

The company continues to expect its total revenues between $315 million and $320 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at $317.7 million.
Inogen exited the third quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected revenues. The robust year-over-year uptick in rental revenues and international business-to-business sales was impressive. The expansion of the adjusted gross margin also bodes well.
In September, Inogen completed the acquisition of Physio-Assist SAS, which expanded its global respiratory care presence by addressing a sizeable, growing and underserved airway clearance market opportunity. On the earnings call, management confirmed that it secured the reimbursement approval for Rove 6 in France in August. Inogen is currently focused on introducing Rove 6 to key customers in that market. These developments look promising for the stock.
Yet, wider-than-expected loss per share and dismal year-over-year top-line and bottom-line performances were worrying. A decline in domestic business-to-business and domestic direct-to-consumer sales was concerning as well. Inogen continued to incur operating losses for the third quarter, which did not bode well.
Inogen currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
