Omnicell, Inc. OMCL reported third-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 62 cents, down 38% year over year. However, the metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents.
Adjustments include one-time expenses like share-based compensations, the amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition-related expenses, executive transition costs, severance-related expenses and others.
GAAP EPS was 12 cents in the quarter under review compared with 37 cents in the prior-year quarter.
Revenues in the third quarter totaled $298.7 million, down 14.2% year over year. The decline was mainly due to lower point-of-care revenues as a result of ongoing health systems and capital budget and labor constraints. However, the figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4%.

Omnicell ended the third quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company delivered strong cost management and operational discipline and also plans to take actions related to cost containment across the business.  The steps are intended to better align with Omnicell’s anticipated top-line performance as it heads into 2024 while positioning the company for continuous investment in innovation.
Omnicell’s Central Pharmacy Dispensing Service appears to be gaining momentum in the market, which is encouraging. Moreover, health systems are opting for the company’s management services expertise to help drive financial and clinical outcomes in the rapidly growing healthcare industry.
Meanwhile, both earnings and revenues were down compared to the year-ago quarter. Omnicell reduced its 2023 financial guidance as weakness in demand prevails. The company is also struggling in terms of its gross and adjusted operating margins, both of which contracted during the quarter.
