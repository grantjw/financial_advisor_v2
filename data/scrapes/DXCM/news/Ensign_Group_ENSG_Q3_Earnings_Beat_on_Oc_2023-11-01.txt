title:Ensign_Group_ENSG_Q3_Earnings_Beat_on_Occupancy_Stock_Up_24
Shares of The Ensign Group, Inc. ENSG gained 2.4% since it reported third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 25, 2023. The quarterly results benefited on the back of higher managed care revenues and improved occupancies. A hiked adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for this year may have boosted investors’ sentiment about the stock. However, the upside was partly offset by an elevated expense level.

Operating revenues climbed 22.2% year over year to $940.8 million in the quarter under review. The top line beat the consensus mark by a whisker.
