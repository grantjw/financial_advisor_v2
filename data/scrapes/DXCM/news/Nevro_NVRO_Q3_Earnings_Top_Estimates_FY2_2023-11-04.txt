Nevro has provided its financial outlook for the fourth quarter and raised its financial outlook for 2023.
For the fourth quarter, Nevro expects its worldwide revenues to be in the range of $108 million-$110 million, reflecting a decline of 4-6% year over year at CER. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $110.9 million.
The company now expects its 2023 worldwide revenues in the range of $417 million-$419 million, reflecting growth of 3% from the comparable figure of 2022 both on a reported basis and at CER. This is up from the prior outlook of $410 million-$415 million, reflecting growth of 1-2% from the comparable figure of 2022 both on a reported basis and at CER. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $412.4 million.
Nevro exited the third quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results and a solid improvement in overall top-line results. The company’s robust domestic revenues were also impressive. An uptick in total U.S. permanent implant procedures and U.S. trial procedures was promising. The improvement in U.S. PDN trial procedures was also encouraging.
During the quarter, Nevro announced favorable 24-month data from the SENZA PDN Randomized Controlled Trial. The data, published in Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, demonstrated the long-term efficacy of high-frequency 10 kHz spinal cord stimulation to treat refractory PDN.
On the earnings call, management confirmed that the HFX iQ and its ability to deliver personalized pain relief continue to receive positive feedback. These look promising for the stock.
On the flip side, dismal bottom-line performances and international revenues were disappointing. The sustained operating loss incurred by Nevro also raises our apprehension. The contraction of the gross margin also does not bode well.
