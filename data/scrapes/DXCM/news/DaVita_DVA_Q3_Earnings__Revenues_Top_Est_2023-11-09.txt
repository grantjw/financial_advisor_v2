Revenues of $3.12 billion in the third quarter were up by 5.9% year over year. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.7%.
The top line was driven by solid performances of DaVita’s dialysis patient service revenues and Other revenues.

DaVita ended the third quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. The uptick in the company’s overall top line and dialysis patient service and Other revenues during the period was impressive. The sequential improvement of DaVita’s bottom line was also encouraging. The opening of several dialysis centers within the United States and overseas was promising. The expansion of both margins bodes well for the stock. DaVita raising its EPS outlook for the year also raises our optimism.
However, the decline in total U.S. dialysis treatments during the quarter due to a decrease in hospital inpatient revenues was discouraging. The company faced continued cost inflationary pressure, a tight labor market and low unemployment during the reported quarter, which was further concerning.
