In September 2022, the company began offering the Tandem Choice Program to eligible t:slim X2 customers to provide a pathway to the ownership of its newest hardware platform, Tandem Mobi, when available. Based on that, Tandem Diabetes is now reporting adjusted revenues as well.

Tandem Diabetes provided updated sales guidance for 2023.
For the full year, non-GAAP sales are estimated to be at least $765 million (earlier $785 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2023 revenues is pegged at $787.5 million.
Full-year non-GAAP sales inside the United States are expected to be at least $575 million (unchanged) and non-GAAP sales outside the United States to be at least $190 million (down from the previous outlook of at least $210 million).
Tandem Diabetes exited the third quarter of 2023 with lower-than-expected earnings and revenues. As anticipated, the company experienced near-term pressure as customer enthusiasm builds for the upcoming broad availability of the new products. A higher operating loss in the quarter is concerning. Additionally, a reduced sales guidance for the full year does not bode well for TNDM.
Meanwhile, it has been a transformational time for Tandem Diabetes, as the company continues executing multiple near-term product launches while implementing scalable systems and processes to support global operations and leverage its infrastructure. The excitement around the launch of the new sensor integrations and the Mobi Pump platform is particularly encouraging.
Moreover, during the quarter, Tandem Diabetes reached the milestone of full U.S. healthcare provider availability of Tandem Source, the second-generation data management application.
