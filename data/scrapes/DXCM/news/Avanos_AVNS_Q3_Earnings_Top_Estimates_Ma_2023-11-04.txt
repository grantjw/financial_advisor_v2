Avanos Medical, Inc. AVNS reported third-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of 30 cents, up 25% year over year. The bottom line topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.
GAAP loss per share from continuing operations in the quarter under review was 19 cents against the year-ago period’s EPS of 23 cents.
Revenues grossed $171.3 million in the reported quarter, down 0.6% year over year. The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8%.
Per management, the top line was hampered by lower hyaluronic acid portfolio (HA) sales. Lower revenues from the Pain Management and Recovery portfolio also weighed on the top line. However, this was offset by a higher volume in the Digestive Health portfolio and slightly favorable pricing and foreign currency translation effects.
Excluding currency and the impact of products no longer sold, organic growth was flat.
Avanos provides a portfolio of innovative product offerings that focus on Pain Management and Recovery and Digestive Health.
Pain Management and Recovery’s net revenues of $76.3 million decreased 11.7% year over year on a reported basis. At constant exchange rate (CER), revenues were down 10%. Although the segment benefited from Diros revenues, the negative impact of foreign exchange and Avanos’ previously-announced decision to discontinue certain low-growth, low-margin products dragged the revenues. Management also confirmed witnessing continued softness across the Game Ready and HA product categories during the reported quarter. This figure compares to our third-quarter projection of $69.7 million.
Digestive Health’s net revenues of $95 million improved 10.6% year over year. At CER, revenues were up nearly 10.5%. The business saw continued strong execution for NeoMed. Avanos also recorded continued expansion of its U.S. CORTRAK standard of care offering. This figure compares to our third-quarter projection of $86 million.

Avanos has reiterated its 2023 continuing operations guidance.
The company continues to estimate its revenues for the full year in the range of $675 million-$685 million.
Avanos continues to anticipate 2023 adjusted EPS between $1.05 and $1.15. The Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at $1.14.
Avanos’ ended the third quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. Its continued strength in the Digestive Health segment in the quarter was encouraging. The robust growth in NeoMed and CORTRAK was promising. On the earnings call, management confirmed that the early performance of Avanos’ newly acquired Trident product line has been solid. Management is also upbeat about the U.S. market launch, which commenced recently. This raises our optimism about the stock.
Management also confirmed during the earnings call that it anticipates a continued reduction in supply-chain disruptions and strong demand for Avanos’ products. This also looks promising for the stock.
Yet, Avanos’ year-over-year decline in the top line and lower revenues from the Pain Management and Recovery segment were disappointing. Management also confirmed during the earnings call that its efforts to reduce inventory negatively impacted fixed cost absorption. The company’s third-quarter performance was also hampered by the ongoing inflationary pressure on electronic components. These raise our apprehension. The contraction of both margins does not bode well.
Avanos currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
