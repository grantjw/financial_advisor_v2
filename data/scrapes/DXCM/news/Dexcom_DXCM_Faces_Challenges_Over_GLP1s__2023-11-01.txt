Ithaka US Growth Strategy made the following comment about DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:
"DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) is a medical device company focused on the design, development, and commercialization of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, primarily for people with diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure. DexCom’s CGM system is superior to traditional finger-stick tests because it provides users with continuous data (including glucose trends and time spent in hyper or hypoglycemia) versus a snapshot in time. Much like Insulet, Dexcom’s stock suffered from fears surrounding the long-term impact of GLP-1’s on the company’s addressable market."
