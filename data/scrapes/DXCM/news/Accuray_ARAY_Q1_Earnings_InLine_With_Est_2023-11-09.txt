Accuray has reiterated its outlook for fiscal 2024 based on current expectations.
The company continues to expect its fiscal year revenues to be $460 million-$470 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 3-5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $465.7 million.
Accuray ended the first quarter of fiscal 2024 with an in-line loss per share and better-than-expected revenues. The company’s solid overall top-line results and robust Product revenues were encouraging. Geographically, Accuray’s performance was strong in EIMEA (Europe, India, the Middle East and Africa), China and Japan, which was impressive. The expansion in the global installed base also looks promising. Continued strong demand for Accuray’s CyberKnife, Radixact and TomoTherapy platforms buoy optimism. The gross margin expansion also bodes well.
On the earnings call, management confirmed that with the addition of Cenos, the Radixact system will likely ensure that treatments change per the requirement to minimize dose to healthy tissue and personalize treatment. Management also stated that in early October Accuray gained regulatory clearance for its domestic manufactured Tomo C platform focused on the Type B segment in China. These look promising for the stock.
However, dismal bottom-line performances and a decline in gross orders were disappointing. The fall in revenues from the Americas and Asia Pacific (excluding China) and Services revenues were also worrying. The current global geopolitical and inflationary pressure are other challenges the company is navigating through, which is another concern.
