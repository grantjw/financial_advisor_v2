title:GM_Delays_Opening_of_ElectricTruck_Factory_Amid_Cooling_EV_Demand
General Motors is delaying the opening of a large electric-pickup-truck factory in Michigan, the latest sign that the auto industryâ€™s enthusiasm around EVs is starting to wane as sales growth for these models slows. GM said Tuesday that its Orion assembly plant in suburban Detroit would start to make electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra by the end of 2025, a year later than originally planned. GM also said it plans to use that time to implement engineering changes to improve the profitability of the trucks once production begins.
