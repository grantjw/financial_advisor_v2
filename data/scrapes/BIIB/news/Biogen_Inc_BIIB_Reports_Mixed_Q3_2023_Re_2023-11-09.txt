On November 8, 2023, Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB) released its third-quarter financial results, revealing a complex quarter marked by strategic moves and a challenging market environment. The company's revenue saw a marginal increase to $2.53 billion, up 1% from the same quarter last year, while GAAP diluted EPS experienced a significant drop to a loss of $(0.47) compared to a profit of $7.84 in Q3 2022. Non-GAAP diluted EPS also decreased by 9% to $4.36.
Biogen's multiple sclerosis (MS) product revenue declined by 14% to $1.16 billion, while spinal muscular atrophy revenue increased by 4% to $448 million. Biosimilars revenue also saw a 4% rise to $194 million. The company's total product revenue fell by 8% to $1.81 billion, but contract manufacturing, royalty, and other revenue surged by 135% to $304 million.
Cost of sales increased by 40%, with GAAP and Non-GAAP cost of sales at $660 million, representing 26% of total revenue. GAAP R&D expenses rose by 34% to $736 million, and GAAP SG&A expenses increased by 40% to $788 million. These increases were primarily due to acquisition-related charges from the recent acquisition of Reata, including stock-based compensation expense associated with the accelerated vesting of stock options previously granted to Reata employees.
Biogen's leadership expressed confidence in the company's long-term growth, citing the FDA approval for LEQEMBI and ZURZUVAE, the closing of the Reata transaction, and the initiation of a $1 billion "Fit for Growth" cost savings program. President and CEO Christopher A. Viehbacher stated,
We believe we have the key elements in place to position Biogen for long-term sustainable growth."
He emphasized the company's focus on execution and leadership in Alzheimer's disease through the LEQEMBI launch and the development of tau-directed ASO (BIIB080).
For the full year 2023, Biogen updated its guidance, now expecting a low-single digit percentage decline in total revenue versus the reported full year 2022, and a Non-GAAP diluted EPS range of $14.50 to $15.00, reflecting approximately $0.75 of dilution from the Reata acquisition.
Biogen ended the quarter with $2.29 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and a total debt of $7.29 billion, resulting in net debt of $4.99 billion. The company generated a net cash flow from operations of $592 million and a free cash flow of $518 million after accounting for capital expenditures of $74 million.
The company's financial position remains robust, with no shares repurchased during the quarter and $2.05 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized in October 2020.
