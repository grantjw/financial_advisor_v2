title:Uber_UBER_Reports_Earnings_Tomorrow_What_To_Expect
Ride sharing and on demand delivery service Uber (NYSE: UBER) will be reporting results tomorrow morning. Here's what you need to know.
Last quarter Uber reported revenues of $9.2 billion, up 14.3% year on year, missing analyst expectations by 1.2%. It was a decent quarter for the company with strong user growth. Free cash flow was also solid and so was profit guidance for the next quarter. On the other hand, it was unfortunate that revenue slightly missed analysts' expectations.Â The company reported 137 million users, up 12.3% year on year.

This quarter analysts are expecting Uber's revenue to grow 14.3% year on year to $9.5 billion, slowing down from the 72.2% year-over-year increase in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.31 per share.
The analysts covering the company have been growing increasingly bearish about the business heading into the earnings, with revenue estimates seeing five downward revisions over the last thirty days. The company only missed Wall St's revenue estimates once over the last two years, and has on average exceeded top line expectations by 5.6%.

This company is leading a massive technological shift in the industry  and with revenue growth of 70% year on year and best-in-class SaaS metrics it should definitely be on your radar.
