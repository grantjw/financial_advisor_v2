"Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) continues to see double-digit growth in nights booked and revenue. Private rentals continue to take market share from hotels globally, and Airbnb continues to take market share within private rentals. We expect many years of robust earnings and cash flow growth, but this quarter's share price appreciation was more likely tied to Standard & Poor’s decision to add Airbnb to the S&P 500 index."
