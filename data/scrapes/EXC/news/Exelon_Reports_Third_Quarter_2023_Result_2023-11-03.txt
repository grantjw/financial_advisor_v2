Earnings Release Highlights
GAAP Net Income of $0.70 per share and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings of $0.67 per share for the third quarter of 2023
Narrowing guidance range for full year 2023 Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings from $2.30-$2.42 per share to $2.32-$2.40 per share
Reaffirming fully regulated operating EPS compounded annual growth target of 6-8% from 2021 and 2022 guidance midpoints through 2025 and 2026, respectively, with expectation to be at midpoint or better of growth range
Strong utility reliability performance – every utility achieved top quartile in outage duration and outage frequency, and ComEd and PHI delivered best-on-record performance for the third straight quarter
CHICAGO, November 02, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Exelon Corporation (Nasdaq: EXC) today reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2023.
"In the third quarter we continued to see strong execution of our financial plan and our strategy to lead the energy transformation, achieving top-quartile service reliability and key milestones in our six active rate reviews," said Exelon President and CEO Calvin Butler. "As power generation decarbonizes and demand increases from development of major data center hubs, we are embarking on interstate transmission projects selected to meet reliability requirements, including PJM’s most recent recommendation to include our proposal to build needed transmission in Maryland and Pennsylvania. We also will be key partners in facilitating two of the recently announced national hydrogen hubs located in Exelon’s service areas, and three of our operating companies were also selected for federal grants through the landmark Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to improve reliability and connectivity in the communities we serve and expand benefits for our customers. We continue to be excited by the progress toward the aggressive goals we’ve set to build a sustainable energy future for our customers and communities."
"Despite an active summer storm season, Exelon’s third quarter performance remained in line with expectations, as we recorded Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings of $0.67 per share," said Exelon Executive Vice President and CFO Jeanne Jones. "We’re also continuing to execute on the $7.2 billion capital investment planned for 2023, designed to address the needs of tomorrow’s grid. We are narrowing our 2023 EPS guidance range to $2.32 to $2.40 per share. We look forward to ending the year strong and further establishing our position as the nation’s leading transmission and delivery company."
Third Quarter 2023
Exelon's GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations for the third quarter of 2023 increased to $0.70 per share from $0.68 GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations per share in the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2023 decreased to $0.67 per share from $0.75 per share in the third quarter of 2022. For the reconciliations of GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations to Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings, refer to the tables beginning on page 3.
Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings in the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflect:
Lower utility earnings primarily due to increased operating expense as a result of higher storm costs at PECO, BGE and PHI, unfavorable weather at PECO, increased depreciation expense at BGE and PHI, and increased interest expense at BGE. This was partially offset by higher electric distribution formula rate earnings at ComEd from higher allowed ROE due to an increase in U.S. treasury rates and the impacts of higher rate base, rate increases at PECO, BGE, and PHI, and carrying costs related to the carbon mitigation credit (CMC) regulatory asset at ComEd.
Higher costs at the Exelon holding company primarily due to higher interest expense.
Operating Company Results1
ComEd
ComEd's third quarter of 2023 GAAP Net Income increased to $333 million from $291 million in the third quarter of 2022. ComEd's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2023 increased to $338 million from $293 million in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to increases in electric distribution formula rate earnings (reflecting higher allowed ROE due to an increase in U.S. Treasury rates and the impacts of higher rate base) and carrying costs related to the CMC regulatory asset. Due to revenue decoupling, ComEd's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.
PECO
PECO’s third quarter of 2023 GAAP Net Income increased to $146 million from $135 million in the third quarter of 2022. PECO's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2023 decreased to $149 million from $174 million in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to unfavorable weather and an increase in storm costs, partially offset by gas distribution rate increases.
___________
1 Exelon’s four business units include ComEd, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois; PECO, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in southeastern Pennsylvania; BGE, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in central Maryland; and PHI, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in the District of Columbia and portions of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey and retail natural gas distribution operations in northern Delaware.
BGE
BGE’s third quarter of 2023 GAAP Net Income increased to $45 million from $33 million in the third quarter of 2022. BGE's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2023 decreased to $47 million from $70 million in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense, interest expense, and storm costs, partially offset by favorable impacts of the multi-year plans. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.
PHI
PHI’s third quarter of 2023 GAAP Net Income decreased to $232 million from $289 million in the third quarter of 2022. PHI’s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2023 decreased to $234 million from $286 million in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense and storm costs. This is partially offset by distribution and transmission rate increases. Due to revenue decoupling, PHI's distribution earnings related to Pepco Maryland, DPL Maryland, Pepco District of Columbia, and ACE are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to net income as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, and other specified items. This measure is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of period over period operating results and provide an indication of Exelon’s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentation. Exelon has provided the non-GAAP financial measure as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings should not be deemed more useful than, a substitute for, or an alternative to the most comparable GAAP Net Income measures provided in this earnings release and attachments. This press release and earnings release attachments provide reconciliations of Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, are posted on Exelon’s website: www.exeloncorp.com, and have been furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K on Nov. 2, 2023.

Note:
Amounts may not sum due to rounding.
Unless otherwise noted, the income tax impact of each reconciling item between GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is based on the marginal statutory federal and state income tax rates for each Registrant, taking into account whether the income or expense item is taxable or deductible, respectively, in whole or in part. For all items, the marginal statutory income tax rates for 2023 and 2022 ranged from 24.0% to 29.0%.
(a)
Other primarily includes eliminating and consolidating adjustments, Exelon’s corporate operations, shared service entities, and other financing and investment activities.
(b)
For ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL Maryland, and ACE, customer rates are adjusted to eliminate the impacts of weather and customer usage on distribution volumes.
(c)
For regulatory recovery mechanisms, including ComEd’s distribution formula rate and energy efficiency formula, ComEd, PECO, BGE, and PHI utilities transmission formula rates, and riders across all utilities, revenues increase and decrease i) as fully recoverable costs fluctuate (with no impact on net earnings), and ii) pursuant to changes in rate base, capital structure and ROE (which impact net earnings).
(1)
Reflects costs related to the impairment of an office building at BGE, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense.
(2)
Represents costs related to the separation primarily comprised of system-related costs, third-party costs paid to advisors, consultants, lawyers, and other experts assisting in the separation, and employee-related severance costs, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense and Other, net.
(3)
In 2022, reflects an adjustment to exclude one-time non-cash impacts associated with the remeasurement of deferred income taxes as a result of the reduction in Pennsylvania corporate income tax rate. In 2023, reflects the adjustment to state deferred income taxes due to changes in forecasted apportionment.
(4)
For ComEd, reflects increased electric distribution revenues due to higher allowed electric distribution ROE driven by an increase in treasury rates and higher rate base. For PECO, reflects increased revenue primarily due to distribution rate increases. For BGE, reflects increased revenue primarily due to distribution rate increases. For PHI, reflects increased revenue primarily due to distribution and transmission rate increases.
(5)
For ComEd, reflects increased electric distribution, transmission, and energy efficiency revenues due to higher fully recoverable costs and also reflects carrying costs related to the CMC regulatory assets. For PECO, reflects increased transmission and energy efficiency revenues due to regulatory required programs. For PHI, reflects higher revenues due to certain EDIT benefits being fully amortized and passed through to customers, which is offset in Interest expense and Other.
(6)
Represents Operating and maintenance expense, excluding pension and non-pension postretirement benefits. For PECO, primarily reflects increased storm costs and increased program costs related to regulatory required programs. For BGE, primarily reflects increased storm costs. For PHI, reflects increased credit loss expense and increased storm costs. For Corporate, primarily reflects a decrease in Operating and maintenance expense with an offsetting decrease in other income, for costs billed to Constellation for services provided by Exelon through the Transition Services Agreement (TSA).
(7)
Reflects ongoing capital expenditures across all utilities.
(8)
For PHI, primarily reflects higher income tax expense due to certain EDIT benefits being fully amortized and passed through to customers, with an offsetting increase in Other energy delivery. For Corporate, primarily reflects a decrease in other income for costs billed to Constellation for services provided by Exelon through the TSA, with an offsetting decrease in Operating and maintenance expense.
(9)
Reflects the impact on earnings per share due to the increase in Exelon's average diluted common shares outstanding as a result of the August 2022 common stock issuance.

(1)

(2)

(3)
Represents costs related to the separation primarily comprised of system-related costs, third-party costs paid to advisors, consultants, lawyers, and other experts assisting in the separation, and employee-related severance costs, which are recorded in Operating and maintenance expense and Other, net.
(4)
In 2022, for PECO, reflects an adjustment to exclude one-time non-cash impacts associated with the remeasurement of deferred income taxes as a result of the reduction in Pennsylvania corporate income tax rate. For Corporate, in connection with the separation, Exelon recorded an income tax expense primarily due to the long-term marginal state income tax rate change, the recognition of valuation allowances against the net deferred tax assets positions for certain standalone state filing jurisdictions, and nondeductible transaction costs partially offset by a one-time impact associated with a state tax benefit. In 2023, reflects the adjustment to state deferred income taxes dues to changes in forecasted apportionment.
(5)
For ComEd, reflects increased electric distribution revenues due to higher allowed electric distribution ROE driven by an increase in treasury rates and higher rate base. For PECO, reflects increased revenue primarily due to distribution rate increases. For BGE, reflects increased revenue due to distribution rate increases. For PHI, reflects increased revenue primarily due to distribution and transmission rate increases.
(6)
For ComEd, reflects increased electric distribution, transmission, and energy efficiency revenues due to higher fully recoverable costs and also reflects carrying costs related to the CMC regulatory assets. For PECO, reflects increased transmission and energy efficiency revenues due to regulatory required programs. For PHI, reflects higher revenues due to certain EDIT benefits being fully amortized and passed through to customers, which is offset in Interest expense and Other and the regulatory asset amortization of the ACE Purchase Power Agreement termination obligation recorded in the first quarter of 2022, which is fully recoverable.
(7)
Represents Operating and maintenance expense, excluding pension and non-pension postretirement benefits. For ComEd, reflects increased contracting costs. For PECO, primarily reflects increased storm costs and increased program costs related to regulatory required programs. For BGE, primarily reflects increased storm costs. For PHI, reflects increased contracting costs due to timing. For Corporate, includes the following three items: 1) a decrease in Operating and maintenance expense with an offsetting decrease in other income for costs billed to Constellation for services provided by Exelon through the TSA 2) lower BSC costs that were historically allocated to Generation but are presented as part of continuing operations in Exelon’s results as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations per the accounting rules (YTD Q1 2023 includes no costs compared to one month of costs for the period prior to the separation for YTD Q1 2022), and 3) an increase in costs for the DPA related matters.
(8)
Reflects ongoing capital expenditures across all utilities and higher depreciation rates effective January 2023 for ComEd. For PHI, includes the regulatory asset amortization of the ACE Purchase Power Agreement termination obligation recorded in the first quarter of 2022, which is fully recoverable in Other Energy Delivery.
(9)
For PHI, primarily reflects higher income tax expense due to certain EDIT benefits being fully amortized and passed through to customers, with an offsetting increase in Other energy delivery. For Corporate, primarily reflects an increase in interest expense and a decrease in other income for costs billed to Constellation for services provided by Exelon through the TSA, with an offsetting decrease in Operating and maintenance expense. These items are partially offset by an increase in other income for the proposed settlement of the DPA related derivative claims.
(10)
Reflects the impact on earnings per share due to the increase in Exelon's average diluted common shares outstanding as a result of the August 2022 common stock issuance.
