ComEd wins national reliability award at PA Consulting’s 23rd annual ReliabilityOne® Awards
CHICAGO, November 02, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In recognition of ComEd’s successful efforts to provide industry- and nation-leading reliability for the more than 9 million people it serves in northern Illinois, PA Consulting, a consultancy that’s bringing ingenuity to life, yesterday awarded the electric company the 2023 ReliabilityOne® Outstanding System Reliability Award, as well as the 2023 ReliabilityOne® Award for Outstanding Reliability Performance in the Midwest Region.
"It wasn’t that long ago that most ComEd customers expected power outages and considered them commonplace," said ComEd CEO Gil Quiniones. "Over the last decade, however, our investments in grid modernization have resulted in significantly fewer and shorter outages, allowing our customers to benefit from nation-leading reliability. This award is a testament to those smart grid investments, and it’s a credit to the 6,300-plus employees who work around the clock to deliver reliable, resilient power to families and businesses across northern Illinois."
All utilities operating electric delivery networks in North America are eligible for consideration for the ReliabilityOne® award. PA Consulting selects eight metropolitan service regional awards including Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Plains, Mountains, West, Southeast, and Southwest. The ReliabilityOne® National Reliability Award is given to the regional award recipient that has demonstrated sustained leadership, innovation and achievement in the area of electric reliability.
"In the face of increased extreme weather and natural disasters, Illinoisans deserve reliable, uninterrupted service to keep the lights on at home or at work—and that's exactly what ComEd provides," said Governor JB Pritzker. "Being recognized as the most reliable utility company in America is a well-deserved honor and we are thankful for their continued dedication to the 9 million Illinoisans they serve."
Investments in the power grid continued to pay reliability dividends for ComEd customers as the electric company delivered record reliability in 2022. Since smart grid investments began, overall reliability has improved more than 80 percent. In that time, ComEd has avoided more than 19 million power outages for customers, saving more than $3.3 billion in outage-related costs. In 2022, 85 percent, or nearly 3.5 million ComEd customers, experienced zero or one interruption in service.
In addition to the reliability awards, ComEd President and COO Terence R. Donnelly will be receiving the Outstanding Contributor to Reliability award. Donnelly has been COO throughout the grid modernization work at ComEd and has led efforts to improve reliability for ComEd customers.
"The complete turnaround of ComEd’s reliability over the past decade and a half has been nothing short of astonishing," said Donnelly. "Thanks to our prudent investments in grid modernization powered by the most talented employees in the business, outages are the exception, not the expectation. But our work to create a more reliable, resilient power grid is not done, and I look forward to the many customer benefits that will spring from our planned investments and implementation of advanced technologies that will ensure our grid can power a cleaner, more electrified future."
As extreme weather events, electrification and other ComEd customer needs increase, the need to invest in reliable infrastructure grows. ComEd filed multiyear grid and rate plans that outline grid work required to support the expansion of renewables such as solar and wind power and beneficial electrification for ComEd customers while maintaining and improving the system to continue the level of reliability customers have come to expect. The plans support the goals of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) that Illinois enacted in 2021, including ensuring that under-resourced communities benefit from the clean energy transition.
"Grid sustainability continues to be a major issue that the industry must take more seriously," said Gregg Edeson and Derek HasBrouck, PA Consulting’s ReliabilityOne® Co-Program Directors. "This year we are celebrating utilities who are providing high levels of reliability and resilience while integrating clean energy assets and greater clean resource diversity into their operations. Congrats to ComEd for their clean energy efforts."
"We extend our congratulations to ComEd for its recognition in exceptional reliability performance and pioneering grid modernization initiatives," said Michael Fassnacht, President & CEO of World Business Chicago. "This accomplishment is a testament to the diligent efforts of ComEd's leadership and workforce, who have made substantial advancements in providing reliable electricity to millions across northern Illinois, a crucial factor in our region's continued drive for sustainable growth."
"Power reliability is vital to companies making location decisions, and ComEd’s ability to provide clean, reliable power is essential in bringing economic growth and jobs to Illinois," said Intersect Illinois CEO Dan Seals. "We commend ComEd on its commitment to grid modernization and reliability, which contributes to Illinois’ position as an attractive place to do business."
The ReliabilityOne® award is given annually to utilities that have excelled in delivering reliable electric service to their customers. All utilities operating electric delivery networks in North America are eligible for consideration for the ReliabilityOne® award. Selection of provisional recipients is based primarily on system reliability statistics that measure the frequency and duration of customer outages. After provisional recipients are selected, each company undergoes a certification process, which provides an independent review and confirmation of the policies, processes and systems used to collect, analyse, and report a company's reliability results. This year’s National Award winner was identified for the 23rd Annual ReliabilityOne Awards Program based on its record-setting reliability and innovation in bringing clean energy solutions to customers.
