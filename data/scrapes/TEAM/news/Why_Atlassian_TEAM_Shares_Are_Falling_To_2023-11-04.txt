title:Why_Atlassian_TEAM_Shares_Are_Falling_Today
Shares of IT project management software company, Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) fell 14.3% in the morning session after The company reported first quarter results with revenue guidance for next quarter falling below analysts' expectations. Management expects ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties to hurt growth in paid seat expansion and free-to-paid conversion rates, assuming that the trends observed in the past year persist into FY24. Additionally, they anticipate varying Cloud and Data Center revenue growth rates as customers migrate to the new platform following the end-of-support for the Server offering, assuming that migration rates will follow historical trends and some Server customers may not migrate in FY24. On the other hand, Atlassian narrowly topped analysts' revenue expectations during the quarter. For the full year, cloud revenue growth was reaffirmed, and operating margin guidance was raised.
