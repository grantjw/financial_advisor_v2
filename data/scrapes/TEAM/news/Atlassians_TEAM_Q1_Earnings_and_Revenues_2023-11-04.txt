Atlassian TEAM reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2024 results. Its first-quarter fiscal 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share of 65 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents. The figure increased 80.5% from the year-ago quarter’s non-GAAP earnings of 36 cents per share, mainly driven by double-digit year-over-year growth across segments like Cloud, Data Center and Server.
Atlassian’s first-quarter revenues jumped 24% to $977.8 million and surpassed the consensus mark of $959 million. The top line was primarily driven by growth in Subscription revenues, stronger renewals, migrations and paid seat expansion.
Segment-wise, Subscription revenues jumped 31% year over year to $852 million. Due to the ongoing shift toward cloud, the increasing number of customers coupled with higher prices on some products boosted the company's quarterly revenues. Our estimate for Subscription revenues was pegged at $840.3 million.

Sales from the Maintenance business decreased 30.7% year over year to $78.6 million. The decline was primarily due to the company’s planned end of providing maintenance and support for its Server offerings, beginning in February 2024. Our estimate for Maintenance revenues was pegged at $61.2 million.
Atlassian’s Other revenues (including perpetual license revenues) increased 10.2% year over year to $47.2 million. Our estimate for Other revenues was pegged at $52.4 million.
During the first quarter, Cloud revenues were $604.6 million, representing 27.3% year-over-year growth. Meanwhile, revenues from the Data Center rose 42% to $243 million. Marketplace and services revenues were $51.4 million, reflecting an 8.7% year-over-year surge. However, revenues from Server declined 30.8% to $78.8 million.
Our revenue estimates for the Cloud, Data Center, Marketplace and Services and Server businesses were pegged at $600.7 million, $222 million, $75.2 million and $56 million, respectively.
Atlassian added more than 2,663 net new customers, bringing the total count to over 265,000 customers on an active subscription or maintenance agreement basis in the reported quarter. A large number of customers are opting for cloud offerings amid the ongoing cloud migration. Such new additions and increased pricing on certain products contributed to the company’s quarterly revenues.
The company’s non-GAAP gross profit climbed 20.2% year over year to $822.3 million. The non-GAAP gross margin contracted 70 basis points to 84.1% during the quarter. The decrease primarily resulted from investments aimed at meeting the increasing demand for Atlassian’s Cloud services and the ongoing shift in revenue composition toward cloud-based offerings.
TEAM’s non-GAAP operating income increased 52.1% year over year to $224.9 million, while its non-GAAP operating margin increased to 23% from 18.3% in the year-ago quarter. The operating income is benefiting from the company’s focus on cost management.
The company ended the first quarter of fiscal 2024 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.24 billion, up from $2.11 billion at the end of the previous quarter.
In the fiscal first quarter, TEAM generated operating and free cash flows of $167 million and $163.3 million, respectively.

It now forecasts non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 20% compared with the previous guidance of 18.5%.
The company provided guidance for the second quarter. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the company anticipates revenues between $1.01 billion and $1.03 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 1.01 billion.
