Last week, Cruise, the robotaxi unit under the umbrella of General Motors , shuttered its driverless operations across all its fleets for the foreseeable future. The decision to do so came days after the California Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the company's license to operate driverless vehicles in the state, citing safety concerns. The operational pause was initiated, according to a statement, to give Cruise more time to re-examine the safety of its processes and systems.
