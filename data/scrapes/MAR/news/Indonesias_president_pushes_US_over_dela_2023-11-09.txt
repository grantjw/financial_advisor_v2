title:Indonesias_president_pushes_US_over_delayed_20bn_funding_for_green_transition
Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo has called on the west to release a promised $20bn to finance his country’s green energy transition and do more to support its critical minerals industry, which underpins emerging technologies such as electric vehicles and batteries. In an interview with the Financial Times, Widodo said there was “tremendous” concern in Indonesia over the delay of the funds, which a group of advanced economies, led by the US, promised a year ago to help accelerate the closure of its coal-powered plants.
