title:Jamie_Dimon_to_Sell_JPMorgan_Stock_for_First_Time_a_Very_UnBuffett_Like_Move
Jamie Dimon greatly admires Warren Buffett but he’s not following Buffett’s lead as far as his large holding in JPMorgan Chase stock. The 67-year-old Dimon, the longtime CEO of JPMorgan Chase (ticker: JPM) said today in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he and his family plan to sell a portion of their holdings “for financial diversification and tax-planning purposes” starting in 2024. Dimon, the CEO since 2006, and his family hold about 8.6 million shares worth $1.2 billion and plan to sell one million shares.
