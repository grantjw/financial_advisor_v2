title:Is_Diamondback_FANG_Poised_for_a_Robust_Q3_Earnings_Show
Diamondback Energy FANG is set to release third-quarter results on Nov 6. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $4.90 per share on revenues of $2 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the Permian-focused oil and gas producer’s performance in the September quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at FANG’s previous-quarter performance first.
In the last reported quarter, this Midland, TX-based upstream player missed the consensus mark due to lower overall realization. Diamondback had reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.68 for the second quarter, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.92. However, revenues of $1.9 billion sneaked past the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4% on higher-than-expected production.FANG missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters and beat in the other, resulting in an earnings surprise of (2.7%), on average. This is depicted in the graph below:

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 24.4% deterioration year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 10.7% decrease from the year-ago period.
Diamondback Energy is expected to have benefited from higher production during the third quarter. The company continues to churn out impressive volumes from its wide inventory of drill-ready locations in the Permian Basin — America's hottest and lowest-cost shale region. Consequently, our expectation for FANG’s average third-quarter volume is pegged at 442,803 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), 13.4% up from the year-ago quarter’s level of 390,630 BOE/d.On a further bullish note, the decrease in Diamondback Energy’s costs might have buoyed its to-be-reported bottom line. Our estimate for lease operating cost per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) is pegged at $4.91, indicating a drop from $5.09 reported in the year-ago quarter. Our model also predicts the company’s total cash operating expenses to fall 3.9% year over year to $11.50 per BOE.
