In this article, we discuss the 12 best crude oil stocks to buy as tensions rise. To skip the detailed analysis of the crude oil market, go directly to the 5 Best Crude Oil Stocks To Buy.
Amid the bear market of 2022, oil stocks stood out as some of the few success stories. While inflation negatively impacted consumer spending and business sentiment, it had a positive effect on the price of crude oil. Additionally, Russia's invasion of Ukraine further boosted the performance of oil stocks, which managed to achieve significant gains, despite the S&P 500 index's approximately 20% loss for the year. However, 2023 tells a different tale. Crude oil prices have experienced a substantial decrease, nearly halving from their 2022 peak at around $120 per barrel. As a consequence, oil stocks have faced challenges in the current year.
With that said, oil prices had already climbed to nearly $98 per barrel in mid-September following the decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend their voluntary production cuts until the end of the year. This move, along with dwindling crude oil and distillate inventories, had drawn considerable attention and pushed prices higher. According to the IEA Oil Market Report (OMR), the market began to focus on the possibility of "higher for longer" interest rates that might impede economic and demand growth. However, as October began, benchmark Brent futures experienced a significant drop of over $12 per barrel, falling to $84 per barrel. This shift was due to concerns about deteriorating macroeconomic indicators and signs of demand decline in the United States, exemplified by a sharp drop in gasoline deliveries to their lowest levels in two decades.
In addition, the recent surge in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, a region responsible for more than a third of the world's seaborne oil trade, has left financial markets on edge. Following Hamas' unexpected attack on Israel on October 7, traders wasted no time factoring in a risk premium of $3-4 per barrel as markets opened. Since then, oil prices have somewhat stabilized, with Brent futures trading at approximately $87 per barrel at the time of this writing. While there hasn't been a direct impact on physical oil supply, markets will remain in a state of anticipation as the crisis continues to unfold.
On the other hand, data from China has shown positive signs as the year persisted. In a September report, the research firm Wood Mackenzie predicted that 2023 would mark another year of robust post-COVID recovery. The company anticipates a 2.0 million barrels per day increase in global oil demand for the year, only slightly below the figures from 2022. Wood Mackenzie noted that, despite growth uncertainties, China would be a significant contributor to this expansion, rebounding from the extensive pandemic-related lockdowns experienced in the previous year. Currently, global demand is hitting a new record high, surpassing 102 million barrels per day.
In today's market, crude oil stocks may exhibit volatility, yet several of them continue to stand out as some of the most profitable companies globally, providing decent shareholder returns. A few notable crude oil stocks that warrant investors' attention include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB).
