And just like that — your streaming bill went up (again).
Apple (AAPL) became the latest platform to raise prices after announcing on Wednesday that the monthly cost of streaming service Apple TV+ will go up by $3 to $9.99 for new subscribers. Existing subscribers will see the price change take effect within 30 days or on their next renewal date.
The company also raised prices on other subscription services like Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and its bundled offering Apple One.
Streaming prices have ballooned across the board as profitability becomes top of mind for media companies — and even tech giants like Apple and Alphabet (GOOGL).
Prior to Apple's reveal, Netflix (NFLX) announced it will be raising prices in the US, UK, and France during its quarterly earnings announcement last week. Its Basic and Premium plans will now cost $11.99 and $22.99, respectively, in the US. That's up from the prior $9.99 and $19.99 price points. Netflix’s $6.99 ad-supported plan and $15.49 Standard plan will stay the same price.
Disney (DIS) hiked streaming prices on Oct. 12 for the second time this year. The price of the Disney+ ad-free plan jumped to $13.99 a month in the US, up from the prior $10.99. That's now double the $6.99 monthly cost Disney charged for the service when it first launched in 2019.
Hulu's ad-free plan increased by $3 a month to $17.99 a month, while ESPN+ went up $1 to $10.99 a month.
And that's not all.
Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), which raised the price of its ad-free Max offering in January by $1 to $15.99, announced earlier this month that it would raise the price of its ad-free Discovery+ streaming platform by $2 to $8.99.
Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA) upped the cost of its ad-supported plan by $1 to $5.99 and its ad-free plan by $2 to $11.99 in August. It was the first time Peacock had raised its streaming prices.
In June, Paramount (PARA) launched its Paramount+ with Showtime streaming offering for $11.99 a month — $2 more than the previous price for a Paramount+ subscription. It also raised the prices of its ad-supported tier by $1 to $5.99.
Even cable replacement services like Alphabet's YouTube TV and Disney's Hulu + Live TV have seen prices leap from prior levels.
YouTube TV jumped to $72.99 from $64.99 in March while Hulu + Live TV with ads jumped from $69.99 to $76.99. The ad-free version now costs $89.99, up from the prior $82.99.
Added up, the cost of these services now rival the dreaded cable TV bundle of years past — the very thing that streaming set out to undo.
Consumers are taking notice with subscribers canceling more of their plans to combat rising costs. According to a new report from Antenna, US subscribers are canceling streaming services at record rates with 6% of overall subscribers cancelling plans in September — the highest recorded rate.
