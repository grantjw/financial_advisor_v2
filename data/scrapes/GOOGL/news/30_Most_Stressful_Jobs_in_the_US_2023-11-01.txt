Stressful jobs, which come with relentless deadlines and constant pressure, can take a toll on employees' quality of work and productivity. Over time, this unrelenting stress can lead to burnout and emotional and physical exhaustion, causing their job performance to suffer. These employees often bear the weight of critical tasks in healthcare, emergency services, and other fields, so we must express our gratitude for their hard work and resilience. Just like high-stress jobs exist in the world, there are also low-stress jobs like proofreaders and painters. To read more about low-stress jobs, see low-stress jobs that pay well without a degree. 
To understand the gravity of the issue, we must highlight that the state of burnout among employees is a growing concern, with significant numbers pointing to its prevalence. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated corporate challenges for employee mental health and have, since led to a rise in burnout. A global survey of nearly 15,000 employees and 1,000 HR decision-makers across 15 countries between February and April 2022 revealed that, on average, one in four employees reported experiencing burnout symptoms. This high rate is consistent across different demographics and industries.
The survey also highlighted a disconnect between employers and employees regarding mental health and well-being perceptions. Employers consistently rated workplace dimensions associated with mental health and well-being more favorably than employees, with an average 22 percent gap between perceptions. Toxic workplace behavior was a significant predictor of burnout symptoms and intent to leave, with one in four employees reporting high rates of toxic behavior at work. This pervasive issue has real costs to workforce productivity, potentially driving up attrition rates and other negative organizational outcomes.

To list the 30 most stressful jobs in the US, we identified three common characteristics of high-stress jobs. First, stressful jobs have high workloads involving too many tasks, tight deadlines, or long working hours. Secondly, stressful jobs also lack autonomy. This means that when employees feel they have little say in performing their tasks or making decisions, their jobs become stressful. Lastly, stressful jobs can involve ‘do or die’ situations, where high-stakes decisions and actions must be made under intense pressure.  
We understand that these qualities or characteristics are subjective and depend on the perception of the individual in question. Hence, after reading several Reddit threads related to such jobs, we have tried to give an overall score to high-stress levels. The jobs listed have a mix of all the above indicators, and the scoring is based on consensus out of a total score of 60. A higher score indicates higher stress and, hence, a higher ranking.
