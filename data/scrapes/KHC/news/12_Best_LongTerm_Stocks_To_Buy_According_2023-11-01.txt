At the age of 93, Warren Buffett's net worth has reached $116.2 billion. Buffett has consistently prioritized a deep understanding of a company's inner workings before making an investment. His investment strategy revolves around identifying businesses with robust and scalable models, poised for expansion and market dominance, ultimately benefiting from the resulting increase in stock value. Buffett ranks among the highest-earning hedge fund managers, thanks to the consistent returns his investments have historically yielded through Berkshire Hathaway. The renowned investor possesses a remarkable track record with his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, which has delivered an annualized return of 19.8% from 1965 to 2022. This figure is nearly double the 9.9% annualized return of the S&P 500. Lately, the billionaire has emerged as one of the most proactive hedge fund managers, capitalizing on the high-interest rate environment. Bolstered by a substantial cash reserve of $147 billion at the close of June, the iconic investor has been actively seeking out investments capable of delivering significant returns, particularly with short-term rates exceeding 5%. To illustrate, he started betting on the housing market during the June quarter, acquiring stakes in three construction companies. These include NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI).
On the other hand, however, the investor has started shifting his perspective on the banking sector. Starting from 2020, the 'Oracle of Omaha' has divested from several financial institutions that have experienced significant declines this year: Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) (-5%), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) (-14%), M&T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) (-23%), U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) (-28%), and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) (-30%). As of the end of June, the market value of Berkshire's holdings in banking, financial, and insurance stocks stood at $67 billion, with an initial cost base of $24 billion. This segment of the conglomerate's stock portfolio was valued at $102 billion with a $40 billion cost base at the close of 2019. Notably, it comprised only 19% of Berkshire's total portfolio value in June, a substantial drop from 41%, highlighting the extent of Berkshire's divestitures during this period.
Buffett's shift in stance on banks emerged in April when he expressed concern that some banks were inflating their earnings and misleading investors by valuing their assets at historical cost instead of their current market value. He also criticized them for mismanaging their assets and liabilities, such as using immediately withdrawable customer deposits to acquire long-term bonds. It's important to note that Buffett and his team haven't completely abandoned investments in banks, and they have not been immune to the challenges faced this year. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) remains Berkshire's second-largest holding after Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though its stock has experienced a 23% decline since the beginning of the year.
With these details in mind, we'll be looking at some stocks that are favored by Warren Buffett as long-term stock options. Some notable names on this list include the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), among others listed below.

Oakmark Funds funds mentioned The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:
“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is the second-largest grocery retailer in America behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery. However, we believe the company’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return approximately 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”
