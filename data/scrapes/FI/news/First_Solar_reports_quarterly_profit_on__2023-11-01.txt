Oct 31 (Reuters) - U.S. solar panel maker First Solar on Tuesday reported a third-quarter profit compared to a year-ago loss on steady demand for renewable energy and raised the lower end of its full-year profit forecast.
Shares of the company rose 3.6% in after market trade.
It now expects full-year earnings per share of $7.20 to $8.00, from a previous $7.00 to $8.00, essentially raising the mid-point of its outlook to $7.60 from $7.50.
The Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which allocates about $370 billion toward climate change and clean energy efforts, provides a tax credit for panels made in U.S. benefiting companies such as First Solar.
The U.S. solar industry expects to add a record 32 gigawatts (GW) of production capacity this year, up 53% on new capacity in 2022, as per a report by Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, despite higher interest rates increasing project costs.
First Solar's year-to-date bookings have risen to 27.8 gigawatt, the company said.
Solar project developers in the United States have flocked to First Solar's cadmium telluride products partially because the technology does not rely on polysilicon, a raw material primarily made in China and used in the vast majority of panels.
The company reported a profit of $268.4 million, or $2.50 per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to a loss of $49.2 million, or 46 cents per share, in the year-ago period.
First Solar said that construction has been completed at its Indian manufacturing facility and it demonstrated 12,000 modules per day capability. (Reporting by Sourasis Bose in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)
