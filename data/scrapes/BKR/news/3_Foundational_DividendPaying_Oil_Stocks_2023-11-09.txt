title:3_Foundational_DividendPaying_Oil_Stocks_to_Buy_in_November
Oil prices have cooled off a little as West Texas Intermediate crude prices (the U.S. benchmark) are now hovering in the low $80 per barrel range. Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Baker Hughes (NASDAQ: BKR), and Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) aren't just well-known industry leaders, but they also happen to be dividend stocks that can boost your passive income stream. Daniel Foelber (Chevron): Chevron stock is down over 14% in the last month, capped off by a more than 6% decline on Oct. 27 in response to weaker-than-expected earnings.
