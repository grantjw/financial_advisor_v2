Baker Hughes' employee resource groups bring employees together based on personal characteristics, life experiences and shared interests
HOUSTON, TX / ACCESSWIRE / November 6, 2023 / The Baker Hughes Foundation announced Monday a total of $750,000 in grants to nonprofit organizations that promote our values and support local communities. For the third consecutive year - and in support of the Baker Hughes Foundation's mission to promote education, opportunity, diversity, equity and inclusion - the recipient NPOs were nominated by Baker Hughes global employee resource groups (ERGs). This grant also supports Baker Hughes' commitment to advancing the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - specifically SDG 10 to reduce inequalities.
Baker Hughes believes unique ideas and perspectives fuel innovation, and our differences make us stronger. Our eight ERGs bring employees together based on personal characteristics, life experiences and shared interests, and are pivotal in driving employee engagement and volunteerism in our global communities. These groups have built strong partnerships with many nonprofits across the globe to drive social change for some of the world's toughest challenges, including education, opportunity and equality.
Collectively, these grants will support an array of causes in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East, United Kingdom and sub-Saharan Africa. Below are the charities awarded grants to drive impact in their communities:
