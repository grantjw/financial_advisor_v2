The global energy market disruption in 2022 had a significant impact on the world's efforts to transition to renewable energy and curtail carbon emissions. Renewable energy, along with sources such as wind, hydroelectric, and solar, has taken center stage in discussions that extend beyond just regular consumers. It is now a hot topic in business, investment, and financial circles. Gaining prominence as the swiftest-growing energy sector worldwide, renewable energy investments have achieved a new record in 2023, with the first half of the year experiencing unprecedented inflows. Data shows that during the six months ending in June 2023, global investments in renewable energy reached an impressive $358 billion, reflecting a robust annual growth of 22%. Consequently, numerous businesses and nations are committed to reaching the ambitious goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
One such industry within the broader renewable energy sector that is gaining notice among investors is Geothermal. Geothermal energy is harnessed from the Earth's subsurface heat, typically transported to the surface through water or steam. This energy source serves various purposes, including heating, cooling, and clean electricity generation. The generation of electricity through geothermal means is viable primarily in regions with active geothermal activity, with countries such as Iceland, El Salvador, New Zealand, Kenya, and the Philippines relying on geothermal energy to meet their electricity and heating needs.
In light of the urgent need to reduce reliance on Russian gas, policymakers and investors are giving growing attention to the previously niche geothermal energy sector, which forms a part of Europe's energy landscape. According to research by Rystad Energy, the total installed capacity for geothermal heating is projected to surpass 6.2 GWt by 2030, marking a significant 58% increase from the current 3.9 GWt. This expansion in geothermal capacity is estimated to require an investment of approximately $7.4 billion. While geothermal technology has been available for many years, it may now be on the verge of becoming mainstream. Widespread adoption has been restricted due to its higher development costs compared to other energy sources, along with associated risks related to drilling success rates and subsurface conditions. Lately, however, an increasing number of newcomers have entered the geothermal market, with many originating from the oil and gas sector. These companies are actively pursuing pilot projects designed to address the challenges within the geothermal industry. In addition, the global geothermal industry generates a higher number of both direct and indirect employment opportunities compared to other renewable energy sources. It is estimated to create around 34 jobs per installed megawatt, surpassing the wind sector with 19 jobs and solar photovoltaic installations with 12 jobs for the same capacity.
Germany, a country that relied on Russian gas for over half its energy needs until recently, experienced a pivotal shift in mindset due to surging gas prices last year. Currently, geothermal energy serves merely 2 million out of the EU's 100 million home heating systems, with a division between shallow geothermal systems connecting heat pumps to wells up to 500 meters deep and deep geothermal systems involving drilling as far as 5 kilometers below the surface. According to Philippe Dumas, the Secretary-General of the European Geothermal Energy Council (EGEC), the objective is to have geothermal energy contribute to a quarter of Europe's energy requirements by the year 2030.
In that same vein, Kenya, presently standing as the eighth-largest consumer of geothermal power, leads the world in geothermal capacity under construction, aligned with its ambitious green energy targets. By 2030, Kenya aims to nearly double its geothermal power production, setting the stage for a remarkable transformation in its green energy landscape. Upon the successful conclusion of ongoing projects, Kenya is poised to secure the fourth position on the global list of geothermal power users, following closely behind the United States, Indonesia, and The Philippines. The nation's ultimate objective is to generate more than half of its electricity from geothermal sources, signaling a significant shift towards sustainable energy practices.
Overall, in 2021, the global geothermal energy market was worth approximately $59.4 billion, and by 2022, it had grown to $62.65 billion. Projections indicate that the market will further expand and reach approximately $95.82 billion by 2029, with an expected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.3% during the forecast period. Investors looking to dive into and play the boom in the growing geothermal space can look towards some of the best geothermal stocks to invest in, which include the likes of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK), among others listed below.
