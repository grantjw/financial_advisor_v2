SEOUL, Nov 3 (Reuters) - SK Innovation Co Ltd , owner of South Korea's top refiner SK Energy, on Friday said it expects refining margins in the fourth-quarter to remain strong due to short supply from low inventory levels, winter stockpiling and recovering China demand.
The company posted an operating profit of 1.6 trillion won ($1.20 billion)for the third quarter ended September, versus 704 billion won a year earlier.
That compared with an average analyst forecast of 878 billion won compiled by LSEG SmartEstimate.
