For the July-September quarter, Fortinet anticipates billings in the band of $1.56-$1.62 billion. The heightened demand for its security and networking products in the prevailing hybrid working environment and the accelerated emergence of digital technologies might have benefited the to-be-reported quarter’s performance. Our model estimate for Billings in the third quarter is pegged at $1.594 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 13%.The rapid adoption of FortiGate-based secure Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) offerings is likely to have supported FTNT’s Product segment. Our model estimates Product revenues in the third quarter to be $499.7 million, suggesting year-over-year growth of 6.6%.FortiGuard security subscriptions and FortiCare technical support services are likely to have gained solid traction, favoring the company’s Services segment. Our model estimate for quarterly Services revenues is pegged at $843.3 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 23.9%.Fortinet’s third-quarter performance is likely to have gained from higher global cybersecurity spending. The growing adoption of SD-WAN solutions might have acted as a tailwind. Per MarketsandMarkets, the market size for SD-WAN solutions is likely to reach $13.7 billion by 2027 from $3.4 billion in 2022, witnessing a CAGR of 31.9%.As one of the broadest security service providers globally, Fortinet’s FortiTrust, a unified solution with a single user-based licensing model for flexible consumption across networks, endpoints and clouds, has been witnessing solid traction. This might have driven the company’s private and public cloud billings.However, softness in overall IT spending is likely to negatively impact FTNT’s third-quarter results. Organizations are pushing back their big and expensive IT investments amid growing recessionary concerns.
