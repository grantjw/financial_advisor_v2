Economic conservatism is the fiscal approach that advocates for a free market with limited government intervention. It is characterized by the principles of individualism, private property rights, reduced government debts, and economic freedom. According to the research study, “Worlds of Welfare Capitalism and Wellbeing: A Multilevel Analysis”, by Chris Deeming and David Hayes, people residing in conservative states are unhappier than the ones living in social-democratic countries. The study observes the correlation between happiness and income, and similarly between GDP per capita and happiness. The findings of the study suggested that conservative countries are likely to experience unhappiness twice, as compared to social-democratic countries. Countries with higher GDP per capita are likely to report happiness twice, compared to the countries with lower GDP per capita. The unemployment rate of a country also plays a pivotal role in determining its social well-being. The study showed a 50% increase in unhappiness in countries with a high unemployment rate. 
For instance, Mexico is among the conservative economies in America, with its low tax rates and less government spending on social welfare. According to a research survey by WVS, Mexico’s political culture is still evolving despite its economic transition in 2000. The majority of Mexicans believe in a democratic state but also exhibit less trust in their government. A majority of Mexicans would prefer to live under economic pressure, without having to give away their civil liberties to have economic security under an authoritarian government. There are several factors including lower levels of income equality, less generous social safety nets, and distrust in government that are contributing to lower levels of social welfare in the country. 
Europe is home to some of the most conservative economies characterized by less generous social safety nets and lower tax rates. Some examples are Serbia, Latvia, Albania, and Moldova, with less spending on social welfare and lower tax rates. The unemployment rate in these countries is another factor contributing to the lower level of social well-being in the region. For example, according to the UNECE, conservative countries such as Serbia and Albania reported youth unemployment rates of 27.5% and 27.2% respectively in 2021. However, the lower tax rates in the region might help the businesses to grow. Prominent sectors responsible for growth in Europe include manufacturing, technology, and healthcare among others.
Some of the leading companies driving the European economy include ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL).

30 Most Conservative Countries in the World and Their Economic Development
Methodology
To compile the list of the 30 most conservative countries, we used three metrics, personal income tax rate, corporate tax rate, and annual social assistance spending of a country. We obtained the tax rates data from Trading Economics. The annual social assistance spending accounts for the percentage of GDP a country spends on its social welfare, including public works, education, health services, food, pensions, and cash transfers. We obtained the social spending data from the World Bank. Please note that we have used the most recent data available for all three of our metrics. Countries with lower tax rates and social assistance spending are considered conservative. We calculated the score for each country by assigning weights to each metric as follows:
25% for Personal Income Tax Rate
25% for Corporate Tax Rate
50% for Annual Social Assistance Spending
We then divided the total calculated score by 100 to obtain a rating out of 1. Countries on our list are ranked in descending order of the total calculated score.
