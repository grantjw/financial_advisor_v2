In recent months, the bull market seems to have encountered obstacles. The S&P 500 declined by nearly 3% in October and NASDAQ fell by 3.43% during the month. It's no longer solely dependent on the Federal Reserve's actions, as it has been for the past year and a half. The positive aspect is that we don't have to be able to predict where the market is heading. Therefore, a prudent approach is to regularly invest in strong dividend-yielding stocks when they are attractively valued, rather than trying to time the market's highs and lows.
Examination of historical data reveals that undervalued stocks have exhibited more favorable long-term performance. Eugene Fama, a distinguished professor at the University of Chicago, and Kenneth French, a notable professor at Dartmouth College, conducted research that demonstrated how stocks with lower price-to-book ratios outperformed the S&P 500 index between 1963 and 1990, as reported by Oakmark Funds. The report also mentioned that investors who focused on growth typically held shares in exciting and dynamic companies. However, in the end, value investors emerged as the winners, as their investments in less flashy and more conventional stocks often yielded higher returns.
We've also published reports showing that value stocks tend to provide good returns over the long term. In our article titled 12 Best Value Dividend Stocks to Buy According to Warren Buffett, we reported that when inflation was high in 2022, value stocks globally saw a 7% decrease, whereas growth stocks faced a much larger decline of 28.6%. It's worth noting that in the US, value stocks performed exceptionally well compared to growth stocks, marking their strongest performance relative to growth stocks since the dot-com crash in 2000.
Undervalued stocks that pay dividends should be on investors' radars as they offer a steady income stream, making them attractive to income-focused investors. In addition to this, these stocks have the potential for capital appreciation as the market gradually recognizes their true value, providing a dual benefit of income and growth. Dividend payments can act as a hedge against inflation, as companies often raise their dividends to keep pace with rising costs. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the best dividend stocks with strong dividend growth streaks. In this article, we will take a look at affordable dividend stocks.
