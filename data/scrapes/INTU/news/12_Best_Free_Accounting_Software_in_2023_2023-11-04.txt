Allied Market Research reported that, in 2020, the global accounting software market was valued at $11.9 billion. Projections indicate that it is expected to attain a value of $70.2 billion by 2030, with a high CAGR of 19.6% expected from 2021 through 2030. This growth can be attributed to the increasing demand for cloud-based accounting software, which offers comprehensive financial aggregation, reporting, and analysis across different corporate units. Cloud-based accounting reduces processing time and maintenance costs and provides real-time reporting. While the demand for accounting software is growing, there is a concerning shortage of accountants. 
In 2020, the accounting profession faced a 17% decrease in CPA exam candidates, and Forbes reported that even those taking the exam had an 11% drop in pass rates for the fourth section. While burnout, repetition, and low pay could have contributed to this trend, it is time to realize how accounting is essential to organizational and economic health. Hence, the shortage of accountants can even result in material weaknesses in financial reporting for companies. To read more about accountants, see highest paying countries for accountants. 
It is also worth highlighting that integrating AI in accounting and bookkeeping is rapidly transforming the industry. Recent surveys indicate that approximately 60% of top executives in finance and tax departments already utilize AI technology, recognizing it as the next frontier in the field. AI, particularly through Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, is revolutionizing traditional accounting practices by leveraging natural language processing techniques to process vast amounts of data. Moreover, AI's pattern recognition capabilities enable the identification of anomalies and noncompliance, contributing to fraud prevention and improved decision-making. 
However, AI will complement rather than replace human bookkeepers, who possess critical judgment and can interpret complex financial situations while providing ethical considerations and strategic perspectives. AI enables professionals to focus on more strategic tasks, which fosters innovation.
