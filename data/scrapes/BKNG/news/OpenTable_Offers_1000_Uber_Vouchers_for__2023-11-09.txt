With SF dining demand continuing to trail national levels, OpenTable encourages locals and travelers to dine out during Restaurant Week and the APEC Summit
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 3, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- OpenTable, a Booking Holdings company, is offering 1,000 Uber Vouchers, valued up to $25 each, to diners participating in San Francisco Restaurant Week. The promotion aims to help reignite dining demand amid The City's continued recovery: according to OpenTable's State of the Industry dashboard, San Francisco dining was down 10% in October and down 13% in September, compared to 2022, which reflects slower demand than nationwide levels (respectively down 4% and 6% YoY).*
In addition, OpenTable, together with Booking Holdings, is leveraging its sponsorship of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit to help spur local dining demand as well as support the San Francisco restaurant community by:
Connecting APEC attendees with local restaurants: OpenTable partnered with nearly 40 restaurants across the city to secure tables for APEC attendees.
Helping out-of-towners explore the SF dining scene: OpenTable curated local guides to the city's top bars, outdoor spots, private dining options and more to give out-of-towners a taste of what the local dining scene has to offer.
Giving restaurants an audience with Mayor Breed: In early 2024, OpenTable and the City of San Francisco are gathering local restaurants for a discussion with Mayor London Breed on the industry's needs and how to chart a stronger future together.
"San Francisco, despite being hit hard these past few years, continues to offer a diverse and dynamic dining scene," said Debby Soo, Chief Executive Officer of OpenTable. "We're committed to supporting the local restaurant community, including finding new ways to introduce locals and travelers to the city's incredible restaurants."
"I am grateful for OpenTable's commitment to supporting San Francisco," said Mayor London Breed. "Their sponsorship will help highlight San Francisco's hospitality during APEC as we expect thousands of delegation members and attendees from around the world. This special promotion will enable us to deliver an amazing culinary experience with our world renowned restaurant scene. There is plenty of amazing food to eat wherever our visitors are staying."
