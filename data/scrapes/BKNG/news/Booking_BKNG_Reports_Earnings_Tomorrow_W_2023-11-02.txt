There has been a stampede out of high valuation technology stocks, and while some of the consumer internet stocks have fared somewhat better, they have not been spared, with share price declining 3.56% over the last month. Booking is down 7.4% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with analyst price target of $3,435.8, compared to share price of $2,788.
One way to find opportunities in the market is to watch for generational shifts in the economy. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks and as a result, the demand for cloud-native cybersecurity is skyrocketing. This company is leading a massive technological shift in the industry  and with revenue growth of 70% year on year and best-in-class SaaS metrics it should definitely be on your radar.
