"We exited three positions during the quarter, including Copart, Inc. (NASDAQ:CPRT), Farfetch, and Olo.
With Copart, we eliminated our position as the relative valuation has become less attractive on the back of strong YTD performance in 2023. With a decline in the expected IRR relative to our current opportunity set, we felt it prudent to move on in favor of superior alternatives."
