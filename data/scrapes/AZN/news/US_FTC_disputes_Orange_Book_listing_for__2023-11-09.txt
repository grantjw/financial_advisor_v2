WASHINGTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday that it had sent notice letters to Abbvie, AstraZeneca, Teva and others disputing the accuracy or relevance of more than 100 patents listed in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Orange Book.
Many of the patents had to do with devices such as asthma inhalers and epinephrine autoinjectors, the agency said. (Reporting by Diane Bartz and Patrick Wingrove)
