The global oncology landscape is continually transforming, driven by persistent efforts to explore, create, and deliver innovative treatments aimed at enhancing outcomes for a growing patient population. The oncology product portfolio is rapidly expanding, with more than 2,000 products currently in various stages of development. A significant share of these products, approximately 71%, is being spearheaded by emerging biopharmaceutical companies. This represents a substantial increase in their role in cancer therapy development, up from 51% in 2017. On a global scale, the past two decades have witnessed the introduction of 237 new active substances for cancer treatment, with nearly 115 of them launched within the last five years. In the United States, there have been 78 new active substance launches in the past five years, contributing to a total of 189 over the last two decades.
The global cancer immunotherapy market, which was valued at $115.01 billion in 2022, is projected to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7% from 2023 to 2030. This growth is primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of oncology cases worldwide and a notable surge in research and development activities aimed at creating innovative oncology treatments. The growth of this market is attributed to several factors, such as the rising incidence of various cancer types, the approval and introduction of new drugs, and enhanced research initiatives by pharmaceutical companies specializing in oncology. As an illustration, the American Cancer Society (ACS), estimates that around 1.9 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the United States in 2023. This projection excludes basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers, as they are not required to be reported to cancer registries, and it does not encompass noninvasive cancer, with the exception of urinary bladder cancer. Furthermore, an estimated 609,820 individuals in the United States are expected to succumb to cancer in 2023, equivalent to approximately 1,670 deaths each day.
Moreover, cancer imposes a substantial and rapidly increasing financial burden. In 2018, a study conducted by Penn State College of Medicine revealed that the top 15 cancer types resulted in a cost exceeding $156 billion in the United States. Ominous forecasts from the National Cancer Institute suggest that the nationwide costs attributed to cancer-related medical services and prescription drugs are projected to rise from $183 billion in 2015 to $246 billion by 2030, reflecting a 34% increase.
Conversely, the realm of cancer vaccines has garnered significant global attention. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) recently forged a promising partnership to combine an mRNA cancer vaccine with Moderna's Keytruda®. Phase 2 trials have demonstrated a remarkable 44% reduction in the risk of cancer recurrence or death when compared to Keytruda alone. Additionally, BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX), a German biotechnology firm, joined forces with the UK government some time ago, cementing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) aimed at providing up to 10,000 patients with personalized mRNA-based cancer immunotherapies by 2030.
This article highlights some of the best immunotherapy stocks for potential investment, featuring the likes of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).

“Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is a leader in the emerging field of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics and was one of the three main producers of the COVID vaccine. Shares fell during the quarter. We believe as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market (rather than government funded), there is increasing investor uncertainty around what a booster market could look like, which is pressuring shares. Looking beyond COVID, we think Moderna has the potential to disrupt the biopharmaceutical industry, from infectious disease vaccines to oncology, and we remain shareholders.”

RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:
“Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN): Illumina was our top detractor in the quarter despite reporting first quarter results that were generally in line with expectations and reaffirming full-year guidance. Uncertainty around activist investor Carl Icahn’s impact on the business, the change of CEO and the possible forced divestiture of liquid biopsy subsidiary Grail (early-stage cancer screening via blood samples) all weighed on Illumina’s stock price.
We continue to view the company’s core genomics industry as offering one of the larger total addressable markets that we cover, and ILMN is the clear innovation leader in sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis. With less than 0.02% of humans having been sequenced and 99% of the variants discovered in the genome having not yet been deciphered, Illumina, at less than $5 billion of TTM revenue, is still in its infancy in what is potentially a greater than $50 billion genetics analysis tools market opportunity. We believe Carl Icahn’s involvement is neutral to slightly positive to the extent he can help the company be more disciplined on expenses. We are cautiously optimistic that EU regulators’ push to force Illumina to divest Grail will lead to either or both 1) much higher core earnings or 2) a big valuation for Grail in a sale. We added to our ILMN position during the quarter; it is a core holding.”
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44

Aristotle Capital Value Equity Strategy made the following comment about Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:
“Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), the biopharmaceutical company, was the top contributor for the quarter. The company continues to leverage its innovative platform to strengthen its product portfolio, offset maturing products, such as Epogen and Neulasta, and increase market share. Over the past year, Amgen has reported double‐digit volume growth, operating margin expansion to over 40% and record levels of sales for cholesterol drug Repatha, bone‐strengthening drug Prolia and cancer drug Blincyto. Additionally, the company remains well positioned to benefit from the continued development and commercialization of biosimilars such as Amgevita, the first biosimilar to Humira, and the successful integration of Otezla to bolster its inflammation segment. Lastly, the FTC agreed to allow Amgen to proceed with its $27.8 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. We note that this is yet another unsuccessful attempt by the FTC to block an M&A transaction of one of our holdings (see below re: Activision Blizzard). The transaction closed on October 6, 2023 and brings expertise in rare disease therapies (including bulging eye‐drug Tepezza), as well as adds to Amgen’s immunology portfolio.”
Like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) ranks high on our list of the best immunotherapy stocks to buy.
