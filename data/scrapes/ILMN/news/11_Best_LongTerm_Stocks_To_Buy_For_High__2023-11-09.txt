The stock market is made up of thousands of stocks. Each of these belongs to separate industries and categories, which, along with the firm's management and product strengths, determines how the shares will perform. The correct execution, lady luck, and broader economic prosperity carry the potential to skyrocket a stock to meteoric new highs within a couple of months.
In fact, we don't have to look too far back to find an example of this phenomenon since one such company has already bathed in returns this year. This firm is none other than the graphics processing unit (GPU) designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA's shares are up by a stunning 221% year to date after having added $316 to their value over the year. If you think these returns are 'meh' then consider the fact that before the mega cap sell off over the past couple of months, NVIDIA's shares were up by a stunning 245% year to August.
Naturally, these are returns that any investor would give an arm and a leg to add to their portfolio. So, the next question to ask is, why have NVIDIA's shares soared in 2023, and are there any broader principles that can be generalized and then applied to other companies to gauge whether they might also post similar share price performance? After all, even if we rewind the hands of time back for just 12 months, few people would be able to confidently assert that NVIDIA's market capitalization in October 2023 would be $1.1 trillion. The reason that NVIDIA's shares have performed well can be put into two words, 'Artificial Intelligence.' NVIDIA's GPUs have traditionally been used for gaming and data center use, and they have often delivered superior performance when compared to competitor products. The firm's strengths in designing powerful products and then managing a supply chain spanning from Asia to North America to sell the products have proven key to its share price performance in 2023 since it is the only one capable of providing high performance products for use in AI applications.
Right now, there are market forces in play that could affect stock returns over the long term. The stock market of the 2022 - 2023 era is fundamentally different from one that was in flow since the 2008 Great Recession. This is because the Federal Reserve had reduced rates since then to bring them to a paltry 0.25% before the recent interest rate hiking spree. While high rates and the stock market are typically talked about in tandem with the pain that businesses and consumers are going through, another key outcome of the higher rates is its effect on hedge funds. Higher rates increase the stakes for the funds since they are highly leveraged entities that borrow multiple times their investor funds to go all in on the stock markets. So, their investment climate becomes tough too, since brokers typically lend funds with rates that add a premium over the prevailing interbank rate.
Right now, U.S. interest rates sit at 5.25% - 5.50%, and as long as they remain high, hedge funds will have to think very carefully about where they invest and how much leverage they take. The less they borrow, the less they bet, and consequently, the stock market misses out on share price growth due to major buying activity. When coupled with the effects of the high interest rate on consumers, who typically see a drop in discretionary income, and on businesses, who have to face off with expensive debt and working capital financing, it's clear that the stock market of today has entered a new era when it comes to long term investing.
When it comes to sifting stocks for long term investing, one of the more popular approaches is picking growth stocks. Typically, growth stocks are defined as those whose share prices carry a hefty premium over their earnings per share if the company is profitable. This ratio is called the price to earnings ratio, and it measures the current share price and divides it by a firm's earnings per share for the last 12 months, the latest fiscal year, or its projected earnings per share. Companies with a high P/E ratio (relative to industry benchmarks) show that investors are paying much more for the stock than the EPS would justify, and the assumption behind this added value is that the stock will grow in the future and justify the current high price.
Today, we'll take a look at some great long term stocks to buy, with the top three picks being Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB), Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), and DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM).
