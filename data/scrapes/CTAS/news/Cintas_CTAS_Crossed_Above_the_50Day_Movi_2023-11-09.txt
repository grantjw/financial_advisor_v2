title:Cintas_CTAS_Crossed_Above_the_50Day_Moving_Average_What_That_Means_for_Investors
Cintas (CTAS) reached a significant support level, and could be a good pick for investors from a technical perspective. Recently, CTAS broke through the 50-day moving average, which suggests a short-term bullish trend.
One of the three major moving averages, the 50-day simple moving average is commonly used by traders and analysts to determine support or resistance levels for different types of securities. However, the 50-day is considered to be more important since it's the first marker of an up or down trend.
CTAS has rallied 5.6% over the past four weeks, and the company is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment. This combination suggests CTAS could be on the verge of another move higher.
The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account CTAS's positive earnings estimate revisions. There have been 9 higher compared to none lower for the current fiscal year, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.
Given this move in earnings estimate revisions and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on CTAS for more gains in the near future.
