Stocks can be divided and segregated by several different criteria. One approach is to sort them through industries, which allows one to tailor an investment approach to the broader economic climate as well as regulatory and governmental incentives that might prove to be catalysts for sectors such as electric vehicles.
Another common approach in classifying stocks is using their market capitalization. The market capitalization of a company is its value calculated after multiplying its total shares outstanding with its current share price. It provides an easy way to gauge the value of a company in the eyes of investors as well as its financial heft demonstrated by the balance sheet. Within the stock market, stocks are classified as micro cap stocks, small cap stocks, large cap stocks, and mega cap stocks. Large cap stocks belong to companies whose market capitalization ranges between $10 billion and $200 billion, and the large cap classification is the final rung on the latter that a firm has to climb before it can be classified as a lucrative mega cap stock.
While few analysts would advise anyone to invest in a stock based truly on its market capitalization, each category of these classifications has its own benefits and drawbacks. For large cap stocks, the potential to make a high percentage return is greater than a mega cap stock, and at the same time, the relative stability of these companies and their higher share prices when compared to small caps also provide a buffer against losses due to adverse business or economic conditions as well as market manipulation and scams.
Data compiled by Stock Analysis shows that as of early November 2023, there are 704 large cap stocks trading on U.S. exchanges. Cumulatively, these have a market capitalization of $29 trillion and total revenue of $16.36 trillion. Compare this to the statistics for small cap stocks and you might be stunned by the difference. This is because the next lower rung on our stock classification ladder, small cap stocks, has a market capitalization of $1.2 trillion and combined revenue of $1.6 trillion. In short, large cap companies have ten times the revenue of small cap companies, and more than twenty times the market capitalization. But what about mega cap stocks? Well, this list of firms made up of big ticket technology names such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have a combined market capitalization of $21.16 trillion and total revenue of $5.9 trillion.
Looking at this data, it's clear that when lumped together, the large cap segment is the most lucrative on the stock market in terms of both revenue and market capitalization. This is unsurprising really since when compared to the 704 large cap stocks being traded on U.S. stock markets, a rather handful of 37 stocks are classified as mega cap stocks. This lends an average mega cap company $159 billion in revenue while the figure for an average large cap stock is $23.23 billion.
So, what are these large cap companies, and which of these dominate the market capitalization pie? Well, one of the most valuable large cap companies in the world, and one whose market capitalization is on the cusp of making it a mega cap stock is the British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN). It has $198 billion in market capitalization, and an average share price rating of Strong Buy according to data compiled by Yahoo Finance. Analysts have also priced in a 31% share price upside to the stock. In terms of its products, AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) has had an active latter half of 2023. One of its biggest announcements came in late October 2023 when it announced that its lung cancer drug performed better than a standard treatment in a Phase 3 trial. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is also slated to release its earnings report soon, and analysts have set an EPS forecast of 79 cents for the firm.
With these details in mind, let's take a look at the best large cap stocks to buy, and some notable names are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO).
