In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 countries with the highest number of heart diseases. If you are not interested in reading about the heart disease market, head straight to the 5 Countries With The Highest Number Of Heart Diseases.
Heart disease is a pervasive health issue that affects individuals and their families and places a substantial economic burden on society as a whole. In the United States, heart disease significantly affects the nation's economy, costing approximately $219 billion annually, as noted by the CDC. This substantial financial burden encompasses a wide range of expenses, including the costs of healthcare services, medications, and the economic impact of premature deaths attributed to cardiovascular issues. 
The American Medical Association noted that, in 2016, the United States grappled with immense healthcare expenditures, estimated at a staggering $3.35 trillion, which translates to approximately $10,345 per individual. Notably, cardiovascular disease emerged as the leading cause of both mortality and disability, making it the most substantial source of healthcare spending in the country. 
Individuals dealing with heart disease face a significant impact on their earnings when adjusting for sociodemographic factors and other chronic conditions. On average, their income falls short by an astonishing $13,463. This lost labor income accounts for approximately 25% of the projected mean labor income, as determined through model-based calculations. In 2018, a study estimated that the total annual income lost in the United States due to heart disease was a staggering $203.3 billion. This figure underscores the colossal economic implications of this medical condition. 
The financial ramifications of heart disease extend beyond the United States. For example, in 2016, cardiovascular diseases in Turkey were associated with an estimated economic burden of $10.2 billion. Significantly, one-third of this burden was directly attributed to healthcare costs, amounting to a substantial $3.4 billion. 
Heart disease casts a broad and ominous shadow in the United States, being the leading cause of death. Around 660,000 people in the U.S. annually succumb to heart disease, equating to one out of every four deaths, or one life lost every 40 seconds. 
The heart disease medication market plays a pivotal role in the pharmaceutical industry, contributing significantly to its revenue. According to Forecast Link, the need for significant heart disease prescription drug sales contributed a substantial $67 billion in 2018, with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 0.6% since 2014. This modest growth can be attributed to the generic erosion of a blockbuster hypertension brand in late 2013. However, the future outlook for this market is promising, with an expected CAGR of 5.5% from 2018 to 2024. Following this growth period, however, the impending loss of protection (LoP) and the entry of generic drugs are anticipated to temper market expansion, with a projected CAGR of -2.2% from 2024 to 2028. 
The heart disease medication market consists of key segments, with hypertension medications as the leading contributor, reaching $32 billion in prescription drug sales in 2018. This segment is projected to grow steadily at a rate of 1.7% until 2028. Atrial fibrillation medications generated $18 billion in sales in 2018 and are expected to maintain a 1% annual growth rate through 2028. 
The heart failure drugs market is also on an upward trajectory, with global sales reaching $6.9 billion in 2022. This market is forecasted to grow significantly, reaching an estimated $26.1 billion by 2032, driven by a 5.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2032. Factors contributing to this expansion include a growing geriatric population and increased prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. 
While cardiovascular medications hold promise, accessibility remains challenging, particularly in low and middle-income countries. In the United States, heart disease places a substantial economic burden, costing the healthcare system $216 billion annually and resulting in $147 billion in lost productivity, per the CDC.
Various types of heart disease medications are available to address specific needs. These include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, diuretics, and statins, all of which have shown their effectiveness in managing heart disease and reducing risks such as heart attacks and strokes.
Numerous pharmaceutical companies are developing heart disease treatments. Acesion Pharma targets atrial fibrillation, Cardurion Pharmaceuticals addresses heart failure with CRD-733, and the Japanese biotech company Heartseed announced in May, this year, that it had secured $14 million in a series-D round for regenerative therapy, bringing the startup's total valuation to $74 million. However, when it comes to the big guns, Moderna and Novartis stand out. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is pioneering mRNA-based cardiovascular vaccines. The Chief Medical Officer of Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) -- Paul Burton -- talked to The Guardian in April this year about Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s development of vaccines for heart diseases by the end of the decade based on the breakthrough applications of mRNA biotechnology that are being researched.
"I think what we have learned in recent months is that if you ever thought that mRNA was just for infectious diseases, or just for Covid, the evidence now is that that’s absolutely not the case, it can be applied to all sorts of disease areas; we are in cancer, infectious disease, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, rare disease." Paul Burton
Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), on the other hand, focuses on Entresto for heart failure. In Q3, 2023, sales of Entresto increased 31% year on year. However, Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) faces a number of challenges. It's currently engaged in a legal campaign against generic drug manufacturers that are eying to launch cheaper copies of Entresto as the company's patent protection for it ends in 2025.

Exciting developments also include Ivabradine, Sacubitril/valsartan, omecamtiv mecarbil, vericiguat, and bempedoic acid, offering enhanced treatment options. Companies like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) have actively been working on heart relevant medications.  However, challenges in accessibility and potential side effects, particularly in hot weather, are essential considerations. Researchers are exploring innovative approaches like targeted gene therapy delivery to heart cells.

For our methodology, we have ranked the countries with the highest numbers of heart diseases based on 2019's death rate by heart diseases per 100,000. We have relied on 2019's Global Burden of Disease Report by Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
Total Death Rate: 432.92 
Russia grapples with a significant burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), impacting its economy and healthcare system. Treating CVD in the country is very costly. Specific procedures, like aortic angioplasty, cost about $1000, while a cardiac surgeon consultation averages $50. The "Siberian Regional Medical Center of the Federal Medical and Biological Agency" is a technologically advanced facility employing cutting-edge medical solutions and information technologies. 
Total Death Rate: 436.19 
Heart diseases are a major health concern in Iraq, causing 55% of non-communicable disease-related deaths. Iraq spends much less per person on healthcare than its neighbors, resulting in subpar public healthcare. The World Health Organization notes that Iraq spent only $154 per person on health services in 2015, compared to neighboring Iran's $366 and Jordan's $257. The market for treating cardiovascular diseases in Iraq is projected to grow by 2.59% by 2028, as was reported by Statista.
Total Death Rate: 449.11 
Haiti faces a significant burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which has become the leading cause of adult mortality, surpassing HIV over the last decade. One-third of all deaths in Haiti in 2016 were attributed to CVD. The country has one of the highest age-standardized CVD death rates at 428.7 per 100,000 population. Studies in Haiti have shown a 5-fold increase in the age-standardized prevalence of clinical heart failure compared to previous estimates. Additionally, community-based research revealed that a significant portion of the population had poor cardiovascular health. Haiti's economic challenges, with a low GDP per capita of $1,149 in 2020, contribute to the difficulties in addressing this pressing health issue. 
Total Death Rate: 459.50 
In Morocco, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) account for a significant portion of mortality, with a 38% mortality rate. Ischemic heart disease and stroke are the primary culprits, responsible for 31% and 22.5% of CVD-related deaths, respectively, making morocco stand among the countries with the highest number of heart diseases. CVD is the leading cause of death in the country, contributing to 38% of total deaths, followed by cancer (18%) and chronic respiratory diseases (6%).

Recent studies indicate that heart disease is a significant concern in Syria. The coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality rate increased by 64% between 1996 and 2006, resulting in 6370 excess CHD deaths in 2006. Before the crisis in 2011, non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, were responsible for 77% of fatalities. A 2014 survey of Syrian refugees in Lebanon revealed that 50.4% of households reported at least one member with a chronic condition, including cardiovascular disease in 10.8% of households.  
Total Death Rate: 513.09 
Yemen is in the midst of a dire humanitarian crisis due to ongoing conflict, economic decline, and institutional collapse. This crisis has taken a heavy toll on the health sector, making conflict the third leading cause of death in Yemen, following ischemic heart disease and neonatal disorders. The country is plagued by extreme poverty, affecting 71% to 78% of the population, with women bearing a disproportionate burden, per the World Bank. Yemen also grapples with high rates of heart disease, particularly coronary heart disease (CHD), which is responsible for about 30% of all deaths in the Eastern Mediterranean region, including Yemen. 
Total Death Rate: 518.19 
Egypt, a low-to-middle-income country and one of the countries with the highest number of heart diseases, faces a significant cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. CVD accounts for 46.2% of premature deaths, with coronary heart disease causing 32.40% of total deaths in 2020, as noted by World Life Expectancy. A recent 2022 studyby WHO highlights a high-normal blood pressure issue (15.31% prevalence) strongly linked to CVD risk. The CDC has collaborated with Egyptian public health institutions for over 20 years, focusing on disease impact reduction, capacity building, immunization services, and public health emergency response.
