As expected, the Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it would keep its benchmark interest rate within the range of 5.25% to 5.50%. This marks the highest interest rate level in over two decades. However, the central bank has left the door open for potential future actions as it continues to grapple with the persistent challenge of reining in inflation and steering the economy toward its target of 2% inflation.
In response to the Fed's decision, Treasury yields edged lower, with the 10-year yield trading falling to 4.77% from 4.88% recorded on the day before. As the Fed stayed put and yields fell, high growth sectors like technology that outperform in a low-rate environment, gained.
In its official statement, the Fed upgraded its assessment of the United States economy for the third quarter of 2023, moving from describing it as "solid" in September to now characterizing it as "strong." This shift in language reflects the recent surge in economic activity that has caught the attention of policymakers and analysts alike. Notably, the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 4.9% in Q3 (read: Consumer Spending Boosts U.S. Q3 GDP: ETFs to Buy).
The U.S. central bank noted that job gains have "moderated" compared to their previous assessment, where they indicated that job growth had "slowed" during the period between meetings. Despite this moderation, job gains are still considered robust, and the unemployment rate remains at historically low levels. However, the statement emphasized that inflation continues to pose a concern and remains elevated.
Market dynamics regarding future rate hikes saw a notable shift following the Fedâ€™s announcement. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, investors have now priced in a 67.3% likelihood that the Federal Reserve will keep rates steady through its January meeting. This reflects a substantial increase from the 59.3% probability observed just a day prior. Plus, there is 75% chance of the Fed keeping rates same in the December meeting, up from 68.9% likelihood recorded on Oct 31, 2023.
