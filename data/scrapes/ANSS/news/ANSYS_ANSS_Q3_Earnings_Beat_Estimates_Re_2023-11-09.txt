ANSYS Inc ANSS reported third-quarter 2023 earnings of $1.41 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.9%. The bottom line declined 20.3% year over year.
Non-GAAP revenues of $458.8 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7%. The top line decreased 3% (down 4% at constant currency or cc) from a year ago.
ANSYS stated that it was notified by the U.S. Department of Commerce of incremental approval processes and export restrictions including sales to some Chinese entities. This resulted in a $20 million headwind to both Annual contract value (ACV) and revenues for the third quarter.
Further, management highlighted that these new restrictions and processes are likely to elongate transaction cycles, causing delays in closing of certain transactions in the fourth quarter. Therefore, it tempered its outlook for 2023. It expects these additional restrictions and processes to be a $25 million headwind to 2023 ACV and revenues compared with the previous forecast.
