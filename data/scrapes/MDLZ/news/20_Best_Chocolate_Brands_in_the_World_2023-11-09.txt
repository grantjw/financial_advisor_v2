Cocoa prices have been volatile recently. On October 17, Reuters reported that the cocoa prices hit an all-time high. The post suggests the hike can be attributed to the Intercontinental Exchange in London, where the March contract hit 3,155 pounds per metric ton, the highest price since cocoa started trading in 1920. However, despite rising prices and costs, experts suggest there is little impact on the demand for cocoa or chocolate. Cocoa processing data for the third quarter suggests that the processed volume in Europe fell less than expected at 0.9% from a year earlier. The report also suggests that the slow arrival of cocoa at ports in West Africa aggravates imbalances in the demand and supply equilibrium. The report concludes by mentioning that the rising cocoa prices may persist, which may have a long-term impact on chocolate and chocolate products.
On October 25, Reuters reported that the Ivory Coast is in deep waters regarding the sale of cocoa contracts for the 2024/25 season. As multinational companies demand lower prices, cocoa-producing regions struggle to meet global demand. As per the report, Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, expects harvest to decline by 25%. With London's cocoa futures hitting an all-time high on October 17, experts bet on prices to rise further.

20 Best Chocolate Brands in the World
Our Methodology 
Our methodology for identifying the 20 best chocolate brands in the world employed a consensus approach. We consulted 4 reports, including Oak and Rowan, BrandBoy, Next Luxury, and Restaurant Clicks. This process was a pivotal step in curating our initial pool of 30 chocolate brands. We determined the top 20 names through an assessment based on the item count across all our 4 sources. We then sourced the trailing 12-month sales figures for publicly listed parent companies and estimated annual or reported sales revenue of private parent companies, depending on what was available. The sales figures were used as a tiebreaker between two items with the same item count. The trailing 12-month figures were sourced from Yahoo Finance, estimated sales were sourced from Growjo or Zoominfo, and official sales figures were sourced from official company reports. Items with estimated sales figures from Growjo or Zoominfo can be identified with the subhead of "estimated annual sales revenue."
