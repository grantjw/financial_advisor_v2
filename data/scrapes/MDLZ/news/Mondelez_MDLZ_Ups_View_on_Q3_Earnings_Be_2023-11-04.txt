Net revenues advanced 16.3% year over year to $9,029 million. The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,678 million. The uptick was driven by strong organic net revenue growth of 15.7% and increased sales from Clif Bar and Ricolino buyouts, somewhat negated by currency headwinds.Favorable pricing (up 11.9 percentage points or pp) and volumes (up 3.8 pp) contributed to organic net revenues. Our model suggested pricing and volume increases of 8.9% and 6.6% for the third quarter.Revenues from emerging markets increased 14% to $3,527 million while rising 19% on an organic basis. Revenues from developed markets moved up 17.8% to $5,502 million while increasing 13.4% on an organic basis.
