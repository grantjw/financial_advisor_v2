In the last several decades, technology has undergone significant evolution. It's not just computers and smartphones that are now connected to the internet. Everyday items like light fixtures, televisions, large household appliances, vehicles, and even doorbells are becoming part of the online network. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the term used to describe this network of devices and objects that communicate with one another through connections to data centers. In reality, smart devices like digital wristwatches, automotive alarms, and synchronized traffic signals have been in existence for many years. However, IoT introduces a more widespread presence of such smart devices with enhanced connectivity and real-time data collection capabilities. Over the past few years, the IoT industry has made significant progress, transitioning from a niche area in the tech world to a mainstream concept recognized by the global business community, with projections suggesting that the global count of IoT devices will approach nearly 30 billion by the year 2030.
A sector with high expectations for IoT device benefits is the industrial domain. This field revolves around the utilization of machinery for large-scale manufacturing. IoT devices facilitate tasks such as error detection, data consolidation, information gathering, and real-time monitoring of factory production lines for manufacturing managers. According to a research report by Grand View Research, the industrial Internet of Things (IoT) sector had a value of $321 billion in 2022 and is projected to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.2% from this year until the end of the decade, reaching a total worth of $1.6 trillion. In the realm of industrial IoT applications, the manufacturing segment dominated with an 18% market share in 2022 and is poised to remain the largest segment in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the logistics segment is expected to surpass the overall market growth rate, with an anticipated CAGR of 24%.
Advancements in technology have led to a decrease in component costs, promoting the widespread adoption of IoT endpoints across various industries. One example of this is the commercialization of 5G technology, which has expanded connectivity and accelerated the deployment of cellular IoT modules, particularly in the automotive sector. Furthermore, IoT applications extend beyond residential automation. They find extensive use in areas like smart agriculture, where precision farming systems leverage specialized sensors to monitor fields, crops, and automate precise irrigation and fertilization processes, contributing to sustainable food production. The growing presence of IoT in multiple aspects of our lives brings data together to enhance infrastructure, public utilities, and services, ultimately facilitating the development of smart cities.
With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best IoT stocks that dominate the market, out of which the top include QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Baron Health Care Fund made the following comment about DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:
“DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) is a leading provider of continuous glucose monitoring technology (CGM) for people with diabetes. The stock declined after Novo Nordisk released SELECT trial results. The trial results have led to investor concerns that Wegovy and medications in the same class (Ozempic, Mounjaro, and other drugs in development) may be broadly reimbursed by payors and widely adopted. This has raised questions about the long-term impact of GLP-1 drugs on the size of DexCom’s addressable market and the terminal value of the stock as these new medications could slow the progression of diabetes for those who are pre-diabetic and reduce the need for insulin for those with Type 2 diabetes. We think GLP-1 drugs will be used in conjunction with CGM technology, which will remain a critical diabetes management tool. We continue to believe DexCom has an attractive long-term growth runway ahead.”
