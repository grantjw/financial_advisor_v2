title:1_Green_Flag_for_Etsy_in_2023_and_1_Red_Flag
There's no question that 2023 has been a rough year for Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY). While other e-commerce stocks like Amazon, Shopify, and Wayfair have bounced back from their post-pandemic lows, Etsy has continued to sink even lower. Growth in gross merchandise sales (GMS), or the total value of goods sold on its platform, remained anemic in Q3, up just 1.2% to $3 billion.
