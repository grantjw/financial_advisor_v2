Starbucks has reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.06, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents by 9.27%. The upbeat performance of the company in the current quarter was supported by the 39% increase in the reported EPS from the year-ago quarter.

GAAP-compliant operating margin for the company also surged to 18.2% from 14.2% in the prior year, driven by in-store operational efficiencies, sales leverage and pricing.

The return of the Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL) in August, along with new menu items like the Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai Tea Latte and apple-flavored Espressos, contributed to an 8% increase in U.S. comparable store sales for the quarter.
