Disney announced Monday that PepsiCo veteran Hugh Johnston will serve as the company’s new chief financial officer.
Johnston has been with PepsiCo for the last 34 years in various roles, including CFO since 2010. He will begin his new role on Dec. 4 and report directly to CEO Bob Iger.
"Hugh’s well-earned reputation as one of the best CFOs in America and his wealth of leadership experience in both financial and operational roles overseeing a diverse portfolio of top global brands make him a perfect addition to Disney’s senior leadership team," Iger said.
