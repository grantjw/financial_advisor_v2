title:5_Safe_Stocks_to_Buy_Amid_Uncertainty_on_Wall_Street
Wall Street is suffering from severe volatility, although October generally remains favorable for investors. The impressive bull run in the first seven months of this year suffered major setbacks since August. Month to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — tumbled 3.3%, 4% and 4.4%, respectively.
Last week, both the broad-market benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite entered into correction territory. The inflation rate remained well above the Fed’s 2% target level despite pursuing extremely tough monetary policies and a very high interest rate regime in the past one and a half years.
Volatility continues as the Fed warned of one more rate hike of 25 basis points by the end of this year and a higher interest rate regime for a longer period. The first rate cut is not expected before September 2024 and the inflation rate is unlikely to decline to the central bank’s target rate of 2% before 2026.
Consequently, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note spiked above 5% last week. This happened for the first time since the Great Recession of 2007. The 10-Year yield is crucial as it reflects investors sentiment on the economy and financial markets.
Moreover, the intensifying geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas may result in a spike in crude oil prices. This will raise the cost of transportation thereby hiking the general price level.
Volatility is likely to continue in the near future as market participants are waiting for the Fed’s FOMC meeting decision on Nov 1. The CME FedWatch tool is currently showing almost 100% probability that the central bank will keep the benchmark lending rate unchanged in the range of 5.25-5.5%. However, market participants are more eagerly awaiting Chairman Jerome Powell’s statement to draw a conclusion about the Fed’s future course of action.
At this juncture, we have narrowed our search to five stocks from defensive sectors like utilities, consumer staples and healthcare. These stocks have strong potential for the rest of 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days.
Moreover, these companies are regular dividend payers which will act as an income stream during market’s downturn. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months.
