(Reuters) -The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved Amgen's biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson's blockbuster psoriasis treatment, Stelara, for multiple inflammatory diseases.
Despite the FDA approval, Amgen's treatment is expected to be launched in 2025 as part of a legal settlement between the two companies earlier this year to delay the entry of the therapy.
Biosimilars are close copies of complex biological drugs.
Stelara, introduced in 2009, has been J&J's top-selling drug since 2019, with sales reaching $9.7 billion in 2022.
