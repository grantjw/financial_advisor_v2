CHICAGO, October 31, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GE HealthCare (Nasdaq: GEHC), a leading global precision care innovator, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023.
GE HealthCare President and CEO Peter Arduini said, "We delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth with margin performance demonstrating progress on productivity and price. Cash performance was strong as we leveraged lean principles to improve inventory management. We remain confident in our 2023 outlook as we continue to innovate for customers and patients."
Third Quarter 2023 Total Company Financial Performance
Revenues of $4.8 billion increased 5% reported and 6% on an Organic basis* year-over-year, driven by volume and price.
Total company book-to-bill, defined as Total orders divided by Total revenues, was 1.03 times for the quarter, as orders dollars outpaced revenues. Total company orders increased 1% organically.
Net income attributable to GE HealthCare was $375 million versus $487 million for the prior year, and Adjusted EBIT* was $744 million versus $700 million.
Net income margin was 7.8% versus 10.6% for the prior year, down 280 basis points ("bps") primarily impacted by standalone interest expense. Adjusted EBIT margin* was 15.4% versus 15.3%, up 10 bps. Adjusted EBIT margin* for the third quarter of 2023 increased 120 bps versus the Company’s estimated 3Q’22 Standalone Adjusted EBIT margin* of 14.2%. Margin was driven by productivity and price, and partially offset by planned investments and inflation.
Earnings per share ("EPS") from continuing operations were $0.83 versus $1.07, down $0.24 from the prior year. Adjusted EPS* was $0.99 versus $1.20, down $0.21 from the prior year. Both comparisons were impacted by standalone interest expense. Adjusted EPS* for the third quarter of 2023 grew $0.12 versus the Company’s estimated 3Q’22 Standalone Adjusted EPS* of $0.87 with increased volume.
Cash flow from operating activities was $650 million versus $622 million, up $28 million year-over-year primarily due to strong inventory management. Free cash flow* was $570 million, up $22 million year-over-year.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release are supplemental measures of GE HealthCare’s performance and its liquidity that the Company believes will help investors understand its financial condition, cash flows, and operating results and assess its future prospects. The Company believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, are important supplemental measures that exclude non-cash or other items that may not be indicative of or related to its core operating results and the overall health of the Company. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allow investors to see results "through the eyes of management." The Company believes that providing this information assists investors in understanding its operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. When read in conjunction with the Company’s U.S. GAAP results, these non-GAAP financial measures provide a baseline for analyzing trends in the Company’s underlying businesses and can be used by management as one basis for making financial, operational, and planning decisions. Finally, these measures are often used by analysts and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry.
Management recognizes that these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, including that they may be calculated differently by other companies or may be used under different circumstances or for different purposes, thereby affecting their comparability from company to company. In order to compensate for these and the other limitations, management does not consider these measures in isolation from or as alternatives to the comparable financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Readers should review the reconciliations and should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.
The Company defines these non-GAAP financial measures as:
Organic revenue: Total revenues excluding the effects of: (1) net sales from recent acquisitions and dispositions with less than a full year of comparable net sales; and (2) foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in order to present revenue on a constant currency basis.
Organic revenue growth rate: Rate of change when comparing Organic revenue, period over period.
Adjusted EBIT: Net income attributable to GE HealthCare excluding the effects of: (1) Interest and other financial charges – net; (2) Non-operating benefit (income) costs; (3) Provision (benefit) for income taxes; (4) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes; (5) Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests; (6) restructuring costs; (7) acquisition, disposition related charges (benefits); (8) Spin-Off and separation costs; (9) (gain) loss of business and asset dispositions; (10) amortization of acquisition related intangible assets; and (11) investment revaluation (gain) loss. In addition, the Company may from time to time consider excluding other nonrecurring items to enhance comparability between periods.
Adjusted EBIT margin: Adjusted EBIT divided by Total revenues for the same period.
Standalone Adjusted EBIT: Adjusted EBIT including the effects of recurring and on-going costs to operate new functions required for a standalone company that management believes provide a better depiction of the operations of GE HealthCare as a standalone company.
Standalone Adjusted EBIT margin: Standalone Adjusted EBIT divided by Total revenues for the same period.
The Company believes that Organic revenue and Organic revenue growth rate, by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency rate fluctuations, provide management and investors with additional understanding of the Company’s core, top-line operating results and greater visibility into underlying revenue trends of its established, ongoing operations. Organic revenue and Organic revenue growth rate also provide greater insight regarding the overall demand for its products and services.
The Company believes Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, Standalone Adjusted EBIT, and Standalone Adjusted EBIT margin provide management and investors with additional understanding of its business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors. These metrics exclude interest expense, interest income, non-operating benefits (income) costs, and tax expense, as well as non-recurring and/or non-cash items, which may have a material impact on the Company’s results. The Company believes this provides additional insight into how its businesses are performing, on a normalized basis. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as inferring that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by the items for which the measure adjusts.​
Adjusted net income: Net income attributable to GE HealthCare excluding (1) Non-operating benefit (income) costs; (2) restructuring costs; (3) acquisition, disposition related charges (benefits); (4) Spin-Off and separation costs; (5) (gain) loss of business and asset dispositions; (6) amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; (7) investment revaluation (gain) loss; (8) tax effect of reconciling items (items 1-7); (9) certain tax adjustments as described in Adjusted tax expense definition below and (10) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes. In addition, the Company may from time to time consider disclosing other nonrecurring items to enhance comparability between periods.
Adjusted EPS: Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the per share impact of: (1) deemed preferred stock dividend of redeemable noncontrolling interest, (2) Non-operating benefit (income) costs; (3) restructuring costs; (4) acquisition, disposition related charges (benefits); (5) Spin-Off and separation costs; (6) (gain) loss of business and asset dispositions; (7) amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; (8) investment revaluation (gain) loss; (9) tax effect of reconciling items (items 1-8); and (10) certain tax adjustments as described in Adjusted tax expense definition below. In addition, the Company may from time to time consider disclosing other nonrecurring items to enhance comparability between periods.
Standalone Adjusted EPS: Adjusted EPS including the per share impact of the effects of recurring and on-going costs to operate new functions required for a standalone company and interest expense associated with third party debt that management believes provide a better depiction of the operations of GE HealthCare as a standalone company.
The Company believes Adjusted net income, Adjusted EPS, and Standalone Adjusted EPS provide investors with improved comparability of underlying operating results and a further understanding and additional transparency regarding how it evaluates the business. These non-GAAP financial measures also provide management and investors with additional perspective regarding the impact of certain significant items on the Company’s condensed consolidated and combined earnings. However, they should not be construed as inferring that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by the items for which the measure adjusts.​
Adjusted tax expense and Adjusted effective tax rate ("ETR"): Adjusted tax expense is Income tax expense less the income tax related to pre-tax income adjustments above and certain income tax adjustments. Examples of certain income tax adjustments include the accrual of a deferred tax liability on the prior period earnings of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries for which the Company is no longer permanently reinvested. Adjusted ETR is Adjusted tax expense divided by Income before income taxes less pre-tax income adjustments above. Adjusted tax expense and Adjusted ETR can be used by investors to review the income tax expense and effective tax rate for the Company’s operations on a consistent basis.
Free cash flow: Cash from (used for) operating activities - continuing operations adjusting for the effects of (1) additions to property, plant and equipment ("PP&E") and internal-use software; (2) dispositions of PP&E; and (3) impact of factoring programs.
Free cash flow conversion: Free cash flow divided by Adjusted net income.
The Company believes that Free cash flow and Free cash flow conversion provide management and investors with important measures of the Company’s ability to generate cash on a normalized basis. These metrics also provide insight into the Company’s flexibility to allocate capital, including reinvesting in the Company for future growth, paying down debt, paying dividends, and pursuing other opportunities that may enhance stockholder value. The Company believes investors may find it useful to compare Free cash flow performance without the effects of the factoring program discontinuation. However, they should not be construed as inferring that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by the items for which the measure adjusts.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Outlook
GE HealthCare calculates forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, including Organic revenue growth, Adjusted EBIT margin, Adjusted ETR, Adjusted EPS, and Free cash flow conversion based on internal forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in GAAP financial measures. GE HealthCare does not provide reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the respective GAAP metrics as it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort certain items such as the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, impacts associated with business acquisitions or dispositions, timing and magnitude of restructuring activities, and revaluation of strategic investments, amongst other items. The timing and amounts of these items are uncertain and could have a substantial impact on GE HealthCare’s results in accordance with GAAP.
Key Performance Indicators
Management uses the following metrics to provide a leading indicator of current business demand from customers for products and services.
Organic orders growth: Rate of change period-over-period of contractual commitments with customers to provide specified goods or services for an agreed upon price, and excluding the effects of: (1) recent acquisitions and dispositions with less than a full year of comparable orders; and (2) foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in order to present orders on a constant currency basis.
Book-to-bill: Total orders divided by Total revenues within a given financial period (e.g., quarter or FY).
Conference Call and Webcast Information
GE HealthCare will discuss its results during its investor conference call today, October 31, 2023 at 8:30am ET. The conference call will be broadcast live via webcast, and the webcast and accompanying slide presentation containing financial information can be accessed by visiting the investor section of the website at https://investor.gehealthcare.com/news-events/events. An archived version of the webcast will be available on the website after the call.
