title:This_Is_an_Underrated_Growth_Opportunity_for_Costco
Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) isn't generating the level of growth that it did a few years ago. The wholesale retailer has partnered with Sesame, which runs a healthcare marketplace that connects patients to doctors and where you can get a prescription refilled within minutes, to give its members some low-cost healthcare options. Through the partnership, Costco members can get same-day virtual visits booked for just $29, with whom the site says are "5-star providers."
