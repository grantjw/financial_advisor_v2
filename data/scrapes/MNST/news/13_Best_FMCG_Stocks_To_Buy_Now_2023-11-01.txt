Consumer confidence has remained relatively stable throughout the summer. According to a survey by McKinsey, a third of US consumers, up from 26% in June 2022, express optimism about their financial well-being and anticipate improvements in the US economy in the near future. This slight increase in optimism is partly attributed to their perception of prices. Consumers are no longer witnessing the significant price spikes that had concerned them in 2022 and early 2023. 80% of US consumers, as opposed to just 10% in 2022, now report price stability in household supplies over the past three months. When individuals aim to reduce their expenses, the initial step often involves cutting down on food expenditures. Within that same survey, about 28% of US consumers have indicated that they've curtailed their food spending as part of their cost-saving measures. In the face of such market environments, the Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)
Fast-moving consumer goods, also called consumer packaged goods (CPG), are products in high demand, known for their affordability, and consequently, they have a rapid turnover. These items are considered "fast-moving" because they quickly sell off the shelves of stores and supermarkets, given their regular use by consumers. As one of the world's largest industries, the global FMCG sector has maintained robust and steady growth over the past decade, thanks to the growing trend of experiential retailing, where shopping is viewed as a social activity by consumers. The worldwide FMCG market is projected to attain a size of $18,939.4 billion by 2031, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.1% from 2022 to 2031.
In the face of inflation and challenging market conditions, people still need to purchase essentials like food. This resilience makes FMCG stocks a more favorable option compared to other sectors in the stock market. Additionally, many grocery stocks offer dividends, providing investors with a consistent source of passive income. Some of the best FMCG stocks encompass Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), among others, with more in-depth discussions provided below. These stocks are also in high demand among hedge funds.

The company is based in Chesapeake, Virginia, and boasts a network of 15,115 stores spread across the 48 contiguous U.S. states and Canada. Leveraging a widespread logistics network comprising 24 distribution centers, Dollar Tree primarily caters to price-conscious customers. In Q2 2023, the company's consolidated net sales, encompassing the revenue from its three primary stores - Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, and Enterprise, witnessed a robust increase of 8.2%, reaching $7.32 billion.
According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 37 hedge funds were bullish on Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR), compared to 38 funds in the earlier quarter. Paul Hilal’s Mantle Ridge LP is the biggest position holder in the company, with 11.36 million shares worth $1.63 billion.
Madison Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:
“The bottom five detractors for the quarter were Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR), MKS Instruments, CarMax, Floor & Décor, and Liberty Media- Formula One. The new management team at Dollar Tree is investing heavily to drive growth. While we are beginning to see some early signs of progress, including strong positive consumer traffic to their stores in the third quarter, these investments, combined with a challenging retail environment, are negatively impacting margins in the short run.
We added to Dollar Tree following the stock’s weakness in the quarter. Investors are concerned over weaker than expected margins, primarily caused by a mix shift to consumable products (versus higher margin discretionary products) and high theft (or inventory ‘shrink’). These dynamics have also been experienced by Dollar Tree’s closest peer, Dollar General, and broadly across the retail landscape. While certainly not favorable in the short term, we view these as natural cyclical aspects of the retail industry that won’t be sustained forever. However, more important to the long-term earnings power of the business, we are encouraged by some of the early results from the various initiatives management has in place. Namely, customer traffic has meaningfully increased at both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners, driving solid market share gains and increased sales per square foot, which we believe to be one of the most important metrics to track the company’s progress. With these promising early results, we used the cloud of cyclical headwinds to opportunistically add to our position.”
