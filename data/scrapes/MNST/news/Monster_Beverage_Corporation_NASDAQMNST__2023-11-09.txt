Rodney Sacks: Thank you, Tom. On July 31, 2023, the company completed its acquisition of Bang Energy, which is the Bang Transaction. The acquired assets primarily include Bang Energy Drinks and a beverage production facility in Phoenix, Arizona. Inventory purchased as part of the Bang Transaction was recorded at fair value. Certain of the purchased inventory was subsequently sold in the 2023 third quarter and was recognized through cost of sales at fair value, which we define as the Bang Inventory Step-Up hereafter in the call. As a result of the Bang Inventory Step-Up, gross profit was adversely impacted by approximately $7.8 million during the 2023 third quarter. During the 2023 third quarter, in connection with the Bang Transaction, the company recorded a gain of $45.4 million, which will be referred to hereinafter as the Bang Transaction Gain, in interest and other income and expense net within the condensed consolidated statement of income.
During the 2023 third quarter, the company incurred approximately $8 million of acquisition expenses related to the Bang Transaction and those are referred to also later in this call as the Bang Transaction Expenses. The company achieved record third quarter net sales of $1.86 billion in the 2023 third quarter, 14.3% higher than net sales of $1.62 billion in the 2022 comparable period and 16.1% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 third quarter was 53%, compared with 51.3% in the comparative 2022 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 53.4% for the 2023 third quarter, excluding the Bang Inventory Step-Up. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 third quarter as compared to the 2022 third quarter was primarily the result of pricing actions, decreased freight-in costs and decreased aluminum can costs.
Promotional allowances for the 2023 third quarter were higher than in the comparable 2022 third quarter, as well as the 2023 second quarter. Operating expenses for the 2023 third quarter were $473.2 million, compared with $415.8 million in the 2022 third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2023 third quarter were 25.5%, compared with 25.6% in the 2022 third quarter. Operating expenses for the 2023 third quarter included approximately $8 million of Bang Transaction-related expenses. Distribution expenses for the 2023 third quarter were $85.7 million or 4.6% of net sales, compared to $83 million or 5.1% of net sales in the 2022 third quarter. Operating income for the 2023 third quarter increased to 22.2% to $510.5 million from $417.9 million in the 2022 comparative quarter.
Interest and other income expense net for the 2023 third quarter increased to $71.4 million from $2.1 million in the 2022 comparative quarter. The increase was due to $39.3 million of interest income and a gain of $45.4 million related to the Bang Transaction. Such amounts were partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses of $13.2 million. The effective tax rate for the 2023 third quarter was 22.2%, compared with 23.3% in the 2022 third quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in deductible interest expense. Net income increased 40.4% to $452.7 million, as compared to the $322.4 million in the 2022 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2023 third quarter increased 41.3% to $0.43 from $0.30 in the third quarter of 2022.
Diluted earnings per share adjusted for the Bang Transaction Gain, the Bang Inventory Step-Up and the Bang Transaction Expenses net of tax was $0.41 for the 2023 third quarter, an increase of 34.1%. The company plans to implement additional price increases in certain international markets during the remainder of the 2023 year. We will continue to review further opportunities for pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures.

Sales of Predator increased 60.3% and its market share increased 1.5 share points to 6.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXA convenience chain, which dominates the market.
Sales in the OXA convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for the month of September 2023 compared to September 2022, Monster’s retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 52.8% to 56.8%, in Brazil from 43% to 45.1% and decreased in Chile from 41.7% to 39.9%. Monster Energy is the leading energy brand in value in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. I would like to point out, the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country.
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period until October 8, 2023, Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 30.5% to 31.3% in France, from 29.9% to 32.4% in Great Britain, from 5.4% to 5.6% in the Netherlands, from 31.6% to 34.7% in Norway and from 40.3% to 40.5% in Spain.

According to Nielsen in South Korea, in the month ending September 2023, Monster’s market sharing in value in all outlets combined, as compared to the same period the previous year, decreased from 61.4% to 51.9% due to overly aggressive price promotions by a competitor. We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. was $733.7 million or 39.5% of total net sales in the 2023 third quarter, compared to $610.6 million or 37.6% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2022.

We continued with the launch of the Beast Unleashed during the quarter, which is now available in 43 states, through a network of beer distributors. We are pleased with the initial results of the Beast Unleashed and are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being available in substantially all of the United States by the end of 2023. We plan to launch Nasty Beast Hard Tea in the first quarter of 2024 with the goal of being national -- of national distribution in the first half of next year. Nasty Beast Hard Tea will be available in four flavors and will be sold in 24-ounce single-serve cans, as well as in a variety 12-pack of 12-ounce sleek cans. In the United States, we launched Bang Energy in 12 single SKUs and two multi-pack SKUs through our Coca-Cola bottlers in the month of September.
In the 2023 third quarter, we also shipped NOS Zero-Sugar 16-ounce cans to support our planned 2023 fourth quarter launch. In Mexico, during July 2023, we launched our third Predator SKU with Predator Purple Rain and expanded our Monster Zero-Sugar offering with the launch of Monster Ultra Watermelon in August 2023. In El Salvador and Honduras, during the month of September, we launched Reserve White Pineapple. And in Puerto Rico, we launched Monster Ozzy Style Lemonade in July 2023, and in September, we introduced our Reign Storm total wellness energy drinks. In Australia, Monster Ultra Peachy Keen was launched in July 2023. In September, we launched Mother Reignbow Sherbet in Australia and Mother Lava Guava in New Zealand. In EMEA, in the third quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Nitro Cosmic Peach, Reserve Watermelon and White Pineapple, Juiced Aussie Lemonade, Juiced Chaotic, Ultra Gold and Ultra Peachy Keen in a number of countries.
We are excited about the launch of Monster Zero-Sugar in Great Britain in the 2023 third quarter. We will expand distribution to Poland and the Republic of Ireland in the 2023 fourth quarter and to an additional 28 markets by the end of the first quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2023, we launched Monster Ultra Peachy Keen in Japan and launched Predator in Iraq. In October 2023, we launched Monster Ozzy Lemonade in Japan. In India, we participate not only in the premium energy drink segment with Monster but also in the more affordable segment with Predator. We recently introduced Predator in a 250 ml PET format in a limited region in India to complement our existing product offering is 300 ml cans. We also transitioned the Monster brand in the Philippines from our independent distributor to our Coca-Cola Philippines bottler.
During the 2023 third quarter, the company purchased approximately 7.3 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $54.83 per share for a total amount of $400 million, excluding broker commissions. As of November 2, approximately $282.8 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate that on a foreign currency-adjusted basis, including the alcohol brands segment, October 2023 sales were approximately 25.8% higher than in the comparable October 2022 sales and 25% higher than October 2022, excluding the alcohol brands segment. We estimate that October 2023 sales including the alcohol brands segment to be approximately 24.8% higher than in October 2022 and 24% higher than in October 2022, excluding the alcohol brands segment.
October 2023 had one more selling day compared to October 2022. In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules, this affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partners maintained inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons.
We reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In conclusion, I’d like to summarize some recent positive points. The energy category continues to grow globally. We are pleased to report that our pricing actions which have been implemented to partially mitigate inflationary pressures have not significantly impacted consumer demand. Our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower land of costs to our EMEA region. We are continuing with our plans to add a Juice facility to our AFF flavor facility in Ireland. We are pleased with our 2023 new product innovations, notably Monster Energy Zero-Sugar, Ultra Strawberry Dreams and Rainstorm in the United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero-Sugar in EMEA.
We are pleased with the early results from the launch of the Beast Unleashed. We are continuing to expand distribution with the goal of being national by the end of the year. We are excited for the launch of Nasty Beast Hard Tea early next year with a goal of national distribution in the first half of 2024, as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. We are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of additional countries internationally. We are excited about the opportunities that the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand presents to us and believe that the brand will fit well within our broader portfolio of energy drink brands.
I’d like to now open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
