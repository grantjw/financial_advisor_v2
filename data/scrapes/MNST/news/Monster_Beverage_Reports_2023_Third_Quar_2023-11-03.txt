CORONA, Calif., Nov. 02, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ: MNST) today reported financial results for the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2023.
Bang Energy® TransactionOn July 31, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of Bang Energy® (the “Bang Transaction”). The acquired assets primarily include Bang Energy® drinks and a beverage production facility in Phoenix, Arizona.
Inventory purchased as part of the Bang Transaction was recorded at fair value. Certain of the purchased inventory was subsequently sold in the 2023 third quarter and was recognized through cost of sales at fair value (the “Bang Inventory Step-Up”). As a result of the Bang Inventory Step-Up, gross profit was adversely impacted by approximately $7.8 million during the 2023 third quarter.
During the 2023 third quarter, in connection with the Bang Transaction, the Company recorded a gain of $45.4 million (the “Bang Transaction Gain”), in interest and other income (expense), net within the condensed consolidated statement of income. During the 2023 third quarter, the Company incurred approximately $8.0 million of acquisition expenses related to the Bang Transaction (the “Bang Transaction Expenses”).
Third Quarter ResultsNet sales for the 2023 third quarter increased 14.3 percent to $1.86 billion, from $1.62 billion in the comparable period last year. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the 2023 third quarter of $29.2 million. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 16.1 percent in the 2023 third quarter.
Net sales for the Company’s Monster Energy® Drinks segment, which primarily includes the Company’s Monster Energy® drinks, Reign® Total Body Fuel high performance energy drinks, Reign Storm™ total wellness energy drinks and Bang Energy® drinks, increased 13.7 percent to $1.71 billion for the 2023 third quarter, from $1.50 billion for the 2022 third quarter. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $20.2 million for the 2023 third quarter. Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased 15.1 percent in the 2023 third quarter.
Net sales for the Company’s Strategic Brands segment, which primarily includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company, as well as the Company’s affordable energy brands, increased 11.2 percent to $98.8 million for the 2023 third quarter, from $88.8 million in the 2022 third quarter.

Net sales for the Alcohol Brands segment, which is comprised of The Beast Unleashed™ which was launched in the 2023 first quarter, as well as the various craft beers and hard seltzers purchased as part of the CANarchy transaction on February 17, 2022, increased 57.8 percent to $42.3 million for the 2023 third quarter, from $26.8 million in the 2022 third quarter.
Net sales for the Company’s Other segment, which primarily includes certain products of American Fruits and Flavors, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, sold to independent third-party customers (the “AFF Third-Party Products”), increased 3.9 percent to $6.7 million for the 2023 third quarter, from $6.4 million in the 2022 third quarter.

Net sales to customers outside the United States, on a foreign currency adjusted basis, increased 24.9 percent in the 2023 third quarter.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 third quarter was 53.0 percent, compared with 51.3 percent in the 2022 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of pricing actions in certain markets, decreased freight-in costs and decreased aluminum can costs.

Operating expenses for the 2023 third quarter were $473.2 million, compared with $415.8 million in the 2022 third quarter.

Operating income for the 2023 third quarter increased 22.2 percent to $510.5 million, from $417.9 million in the 2022 third quarter, primarily as a result of an increase in net sales as well as an increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales.
The effective tax rate for the 2023 third quarter was 22.2 percent, compared with 23.3 percent in the 2022 third quarter.
Net income for the 2023 third quarter increased 40.4 percent to $452.7 million, from $322.4 million in the 2022 third quarter. Net income per diluted share for the 2023 third quarter increased 41.3 percent to $0.43, from $0.30 in the third quarter of 2022. Net income per diluted share, adjusted for the Bang Transaction Gain, the Bang Inventory Step-Up and the Bang Transaction Expenses was $0.41 for the 2023 third quarter.
Hilton H. Schlosberg, Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, said, “The energy drink market in the United States, as well as internationally, continues to grow. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid revenue growth, with record sales for our third quarter. The quarter was again impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.
“Gross profit margins in the quarter improved significantly as compared to the 2022 third quarter, primarily as a result of pricing actions, decreased freight-in costs and decreased aluminum can costs.   Gross profit margins also improved sequentially from the previous quarters. Promotional allowances as a percentage of net sales for the 2023 third quarter were higher than in the comparable 2022 third quarter.
“On July 31, 2023, we completed the Bang Transaction. The Bang Inventory Step-Up adversely impacted consolidated gross margins,” Schlosberg added.
Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are pleased with our new product innovation launches this year.
“During the 2023 third quarter, we continued our roll-out of our first flavored malt beverage alcohol product, The Beast Unleashed™, with the goal of being available in substantially all of the United States by the end of 2023.  We will be launching certain flavors of The Beast Unleashed™ in 24 oz. single serve cans primarily for the convenience and gas market later this year. Nasty Beast™, our new hard tea, will be launched initially in four flavors, in 12 oz. variety packs as well as 24 oz. single serve cans, early in 2024. Our innovation pipeline for both our non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages remains strong,” Sacks said.
