Reporting third-quarter results Nov. 7, online retailer eBay forecasted profit and revenue for the current quarter below Street expectations, citing a pullback in consumer spending amid macroeconomic concerns. "We've observed softening consumer trends to date in Q4, and particular challenges in Europe, suggesting we may see a more muted seasonal uptick over the holidays," CEO Jamie Iannone told investors on the company's earnings call. The company reported a 5% increase in revenue for the quarter to $2.5 billion, about in line with analyst expectations.
