title:CrowdStrike_Named_a_Worldwide_Leader_for_RiskBased_Vulnerability_Management_in_New_IDC_MarketScape_Report
AUSTIN, Texas, November 07, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CrowdStrike (Nasdaq: CRWD) today announced it has been positioned as a Leader in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Risk-Based Vulnerability Management Platforms 2023 Vendor Assessment1. CrowdStrike Falcon Exposure Management reduces intrusion risk by providing comprehensive visibility into potential adversary attack paths, enabling customers to prioritize and proactively remediate the vulnerabilities that could lead to a breach. By delivering exposure management as tightly integrated capability on the AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon platform, organizations can consolidate vulnerability management point products, eliminate additional agents and unify protection against adversary intrusion.
"Adversaries are moving with increasing speed, weaponizing vulnerabilities in minutes or hours as opposed to days or weeks. Traditional approaches to vulnerability management force security teams to be reactive, with limited visibility into how an adversary will attempt to break in, before they can cause a breach," said Raj Rajamani, head of products at CrowdStrike. "Our leadership in vulnerability management validates the integrated approach of the CrowdStrike Falcon platform. By unifying data from across the attack surface, assets, accounts, applications and vulnerabilities, we deliver true, proactive reduction in adversary intrusion risk."
CrowdStrike Falcon platform expands to dominate exposure management and IT automation use casesCrowdStrike recently announced two new offerings that expand the AI-native Falcon platform’s ability to reduce risk and create unprecedented visibility across IT and security teams while consolidating costly, complex point products. CrowdStrike Falcon Exposure Management unifies real-time security and IT data sets from Falcon Surface (External Attack Surface Management), Falcon Discover (Asset, Account and App Discovery) and Falcon Spotlight (Vulnerability Management), as well as CrowdStrike’s renowned threat intelligence, endpoint, XDR telemetry and AI-powered exploit prioritization, to predict attack paths and guide risk mitigation actions that stop breaches before they happen.
According to the IDC MarketScape report, "organizations that use CrowdStrike for EDR and have already deployed CrowdStrike agents will find it easy to get started with Falcon Spotlight. With Falcon Exposure Management, customers will be able to bring in third-party scan data so that all can be managed in one system instead of customers needing a separate scanning solution."
Building on the benefits of Falcon Exposure Management, CrowdStrike also recently announced Falcon for IT, a new IT automation offering designed to bridge the gap between security and IT with elegant, end-to-end workflows. With Falcon for IT, teams can leverage their existing CrowdStrike Falcon agents to search all system-related event, state and performance data, monitor the state of CrowdStrike managed endpoints and automate remediation to rapidly fix issues, such as installing patches and changing endpoint policies.
