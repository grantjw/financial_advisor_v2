The housing market continues to struggle due to the combined pressures of increasing mortgage rates, soaring home prices, and limited housing inventory, creating a challenging situation for housing affordability. To exacerbate the situation, there is the possibility that the Federal Reserve will implement one more interest rate hike by the end of this year in an effort to further combat inflation. The federal funds rate serves as the key reference interest rate used by financial institutions for their short-term lending needs. In March 2022, this rate was nearly at 0%. Subsequently, the Fed initiated a series of rate increases to achieve its 2% inflation target. Following 11 successive interest rate hikes, the current rate range now stands at 5.25% to 5.5%, marking its highest level in 22 years.
According to Federal Reserve forecasts, it is anticipated that the ultimate federal funds rate will climb to 5.6% by the conclusion of 2023. This implies the likelihood of at least one more 25-basis-point rate hike within the current year. Modifications to the federal funds rate can indirectly impact mortgage rates. However, experts in the housing market appear to be more focused on the Fed's longer-term rate plans in the years ahead rather than being overly concerned about a single additional interest rate increase in the current year. According to market experts, to achieve the most favorable scenario, a substantial increase in the available inventory of homes for sale is crucial. This additional inventory would alleviate the upward pressure on home prices, potentially stabilizing them or even leading to a slight decrease from their peak or near-peak levels. Furthermore, it's essential for interest rates to moderate, but caution against a rapidly cooling rate is also advised. Swiftly declining rates could trigger a surge in demand that might negate any gains in inventory, causing home prices to rebound.
On the other hand, the real estate sector is presently undergoing a significant transformation, driven by technological advancements and increased access to capital. Those seeking to enter the real estate market should be prepared for the profound impact of online property listing platforms, smartphone applications, virtual reality, and blockchain technology on every facet of real estate transactions. According to a report, investors should expect heightened competition among property listing websites in the near term, all striving to offer seamless buying and selling experiences for prospective and current property owners. While market leaders like Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) have long maintained a dominant position, new platforms with similar offerings will continue to emerge, intensifying the competitive landscape. Technology is poised to play a pivotal role in the future of the real estate market, and established players must adeptly navigate this evolving landscape to avoid falling behind in a field brimming with competition.

In their third-quarter earnings report, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) allocated $134 million for credit losses, mirroring the $161 million set aside in the second quarter. The bank attributed this provision to "deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector." Other banks' recent earnings also revealed challenges related to their CRE holdings. For instance, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) disclosed on Tuesday that it had reduced its exposure to office-related CRE holdings by approximately 50% this year. Meanwhile, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) reported an increase in non-performing loans, which are loans with at least 90 days of overdue payments, to nearly $5 billion in the third quarter, up from $4.27 billion in the second quarter, largely due to its CRE portfolio. Borrowers have faced difficulties refinancing their CRE loans as property values have declined and interest rates have risen. Notably, around $20 billion of office commercial mortgage-backed securities, which pool together individual loans, are set to mature in 2023.
Conversely, the residential real estate (RRE) market appears to be showing more resilience. After experiencing a notable 10% drop in new home prices from their peak in February 2023, prices have shown an upward trajectory based on the latest data from April 2023. Additionally, the regional housing index published by the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo reinforces this positive trend.
With these details in mind, let us now take a look at some of the best real estate and realty stocks to buy according to hedge funds, out of which the top ones include the likes of Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX), American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), and Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD).

SBA Communications is a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure, including towers. We believe towers is a high-quality business that is central to the wireless economy and stands to benefit from the rollout of 5G technology.
