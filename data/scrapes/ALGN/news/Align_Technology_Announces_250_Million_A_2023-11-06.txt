Joe Hogan, president and CEO, intends to personally purchase $1.0 million of Align’s common stock
TEMPE, Ariz., October 27, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Align Technology, Inc. ("Align") (Nasdaq: ALGN), a leading global medical device company that designs, manufactures, and sells the Invisalign® system of clear aligners, iTero™ intraoral scanners, and exocad™ CAD/CAM software for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, today announced that it has entered into a new accelerated stock repurchase agreement ("ASR") with Citibank, N.A. ("Citi"), to repurchase $250 million of Align's common stock under Align’s $1.0 billion stock repurchase program that was approved by Align's Board of Directors in January 2023.
"We have an enormous opportunity in a vastly underpenetrated market to continue driving the adoption of digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry with the Invisalign System®, the most trusted brand in the orthodontic industry globally," said Joe Hogan, president and CEO. "This latest $250 million ASR reflects our continued confidence in the long-term value of Align and our commitment to increasing shareholder value while balancing investments to drive growth as we transform the orthodontic industry."
Our latest stock repurchase program will operate in accordance with guidelines, specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, transactions, if any, will be affected in accordance with the terms of the share repurchase program, including specified prices, volumes, and timing conditions. As of June 30, 2023, Align had approximately 76.5 million shares outstanding and $1.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities.
Under the terms of the ASR, Align will receive an initial delivery of approximately one million shares. The final number of shares to be repurchased will be based on Align's volume-weighted average stock price during the term of the ASR, less an agreed upon discount. The ASR transaction is expected to be completed by approximately January 30, 2024 and will be funded with Align’s cash on hand.
Pursuant to the accelerated share repurchase agreement, Citi will use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct a portion of its hedging activity by effecting purchases through one or more designated brokers, including CastleOak Securities LP, Drexel Hamilton, LLC, and Siebert Williams Shank & Co., LLC.
In addition to the ASR, Align announced that Joe Hogan, president and CEO, intends to personally purchase $1.0 million of Align’s common stock.
