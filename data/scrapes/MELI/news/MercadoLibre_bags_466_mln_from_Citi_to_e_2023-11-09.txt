SAO PAULO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - MercadoLibre said on Wednesday it has obtained a $466 million financing line from Citigroup to expand its credit offering to customers, small and medium enterprises in Brazil and Mexico.
The Latin American e-commerce giant said the amount would be bagged by its digital bank Mercado Pago, noting that around $237 million would come from Citi's Brazilian unit and the other $229 million from Mexican subsidiary Citibanamex.
The deal will last for two years and is similar to a 2021 one inked by the parties that totaled $375 million and has already expired, MercadoLibre added in a statement. (Reporting by Andre Romani; Editing by Steven Grattan and Chizu Nomiyama)
