"[INST] For a car, what scams can be plotted with 0% financing vs rebate? [/INST]","The biggest scams are the ones everyone knows about. The dealer is allowed to mark up the finance rate above the published rate but it's not advertised. The advertised rate is the lowest rate offered. If the published rate does not apply to you ask them to give you a rate with their ""credit matrix"". That's the rate that applies given your credit score. In the US the rate does not fluctuate according to your negotiating skill it's based on that matrix. So don't let them intimidate you if the offer changes for some other reason.  Also it is important to understand that rebates are ""cash"", and the 0% financing is also cash, so you should receive the 0% financing if you get the rebate.","There are generally two scams that you mentioned.  0% financing can cost you if you do not pay early (because the interest on the new loan can be much smaller even paying early), but this depends a bit on your credit history (most credit cards will be around 20%, whereas the 0% can be very useful). The down payment on this car depends on your financing.  That is why there is no one particular set amount that will guarantee you will be approved (hence the ""pretty high""  amount).  So if you have excellent credit, the down payment can be a bit lower than someone that is not.  But it does make more sense to pay that 0% and get more down on the new loan. The second thing is that the rebates can often be higher than the 0%.  So, if the loan cost me almost 20% but that rebate saved me ~10-12%, it would make more sense to take rebate (on this car)."
[INST] Why does it matter if a Central Bank has a negative rather than 0% interest rate? [/INST],"The purpose of the negative rate is not to punish bankers; the purpose is to increase the amount of money in the economy. (That is, to encourage more spending.) It doesn't much matter which bank you make these negative loans to; they'll all tend to use the free money toward paying their liabilities, or towards paying their labor costs, in either case increasing their employees' wages and benefits which will encourage their customers to spend more instead of saving. If they instead used the free money to speculate on the financial markets, then they would still be contributing to the purpose in this way. There are some who fear that a negative rate will cause a bank run, but historically banks have been quite capable of running out of cash without that kind of motivation, and central banks are usually quite good about keeping it stocked. The primary concern is that the negative rate will make the free money useless. This is because a common tactic to circumvent the cash withdrawal limit is to get as much as possible, then storing it in the bank, where the cash is multiplied by a factor of 100 until it is in the negative territory, and then withdrawn as cash. This process isn't guaranteed to work - for one thing, if the cash withdrawal limit is raised, then the negative interest rate could cause the banks to lose money, which will surely change their priorities - but it is still a potential hazard. The other concern is that a negative rate will create a run on the government, but people will continue their normal spending patterns in the face of a negative interest rate and won't be affected by this. These two concerns have been somewhat addressed by the fact that the negative rate is usually a minimum rate rather than a maximum rate, meaning that there is still an effective zero rate. However, a minimum rather than a maximum rate has another effect: it gives the central bank control over exactly how much money is in the economy rather than them being at the mercy of the financial markets.","Since people would be better off, all else equal, getting a positive rate of return, negative interest rates will encourage some proportion of people to keep some portion of their wealth in the form of cash (which is equivalent to being on deposit at the central bank). At the same time savers get paid for keeping the cash in the bank, borrowers pay for the privilege of getting a loan at the same time that the bank is earning interest. To make all this work, the central bank has to be able to offer competitive interest rates -- and we're back to quantitative easing!"
[INST] Where should I be investing my money? [/INST],"The best answer would depend heavily on your situation and financial goals. However, I'll outline a couple of typical, risk-averse choices.","If you're 21, here are my suggestions: I hope this helps.  Good luck!"
[INST] Specifically when do options expire? [/INST],"There is an open house every day, but most option contracts are for short time windows around economic events (monthly or weekly) There are options that are very liquid that trade through the open house and these do have expirations, but they are rare. Usually at 3m - 1yr","Your table leaves out a crucial fact: an American stock option is in the money if the underlying stock is worth more than the strike price (the option's strike price) plus the transaction costs.  That is, if the stock is worth $10.50 but your strike is $9 a call option is in the money for you to exercise before expiry.  On the contrary, a British stock option is only in the money upon expiry if it is exercised.  You cannot exercise early unless the option is out of the money: the stock price is below the stated strike price.  So there is a much higher chance of early exercise if the option is an American.  It doesn't mean though that you can exercise for free, you'd have to incur the transaction costs that you would normally incur when purchasing the stock and also the costs associated with the exercising of the option itself.  If the option is deeply out of the money, however, it's still possible for you to exercise your American option before expiry despite it being in the money. It is because American calls (at least) are in the money if the strike price is above the transaction price plus costs.  You can therefore choose to not exercise if you want to make some money on your option while it still has some value.  Again, you'd still have some associated transaction costs but the option may already be worth more than a few dollars at some point before it expires depending on the stock price and the strike price.  The opposite is the case for a British call, your option is rendered 'useless' (not in the money) if the stock price dips just below the strike price."
[INST] Negative Balance from Automatic Options Exercise. What to do? [/INST],"There are a few reasons why a stock might move away from the strike price right at or close to expiration. You might need to look into the options chain for a clue: 1) You have in-the-money options, including deep in-the-money calls, and options holders exercised early. 2) A large transaction is made at $28.60, meaning that people will not take delivery at that price. Or that was the last good price before people backed off their bids. 3) A large amount of the options were in the zone where the holder could earn more by exercising them, as oppose to selling, meaning that they exercised. 4) Your stock has been on the move. If it is breaking out of a channel of previous highs and lows, and the previous highs were at a higher price, it will have the momentum to move to a new high price, which might be what happened here. 5) A small price drop on very heavy volume, meaning that at one point a lot of people thought they were in, and after buying in, a lot of people decided they were out again. This might be the case.","First: I don't know your trading history so I can't say specifically, but you may have an overfunded ""foolish"" margin account. You should check your account for positions that you might not have realized you had. There's no way to know specifically what is wrong but you should be able to determine if your account has been overfunded with cash, or if there is something weird in your portfolio that you never bought. If you're missing large positions then talk to your broker. Here's some general information about margin accounts. If your account balance really is a negative number as you say, then this is a mistake your broker made, or at least something went wrong. Either that, or someone ""took"" all the money from the account and you need to reconsider who has access to your account. Either way: your broker should have enough money in your account to cover transactions they make on your behalf, otherwise they would fail and be banned from doing any future transaction. So while it can take some time, the mistake should be fixable. Hopefully you can get back to trading (if you're doing this through an online broker, not a firm that deals with the exchange directly, they should close out your positions within a couple days."
[INST] Approximation of equity value for company in default [/INST],"1. Get a copy of the last filed financial statement. Any public company with any size will have one and the easiest place to find it is on their home page unless they have a special exception to not file it with the SEC. 2. Get a copy of any subsequent quarterly filing from the SEC EDGAR database. http://www.sec.gov/edgarsearches/edgarsearches.html. 3. Open and read. That will give you everything in the world about their revenues, expenses, liabilities, etc. Most, not all, but most of their capital structure is publicly available.  As far as if the stock will actually be repaid it is doubtful.   The stock has 30 days to get the vote and the bond holders hold an absolute majority. I will be surprised if a cash dividend is approved.","You might be making some assumptions here that don't necessarily reflect the way the creditors are proceeding: Creditors may not have received all payments in full until the last payment is made.  If you are trying to calculate the amount of money a credit, that's fine. You could use the amount that creditor has advanced and the amount that creditor is to be paid. The final payment will go to the claimants but this will only happen when all other parties have been paid all of what they are owed (perhaps the banks are to receive 50% repayments, in which case the funds are held by the bank until all payments of 50% have been distributed). The creditors may also not have paid the full amount owed, which may have been 20% of claims received.  That means they may have distributed 20% of claims received.  Any amount over the initial claim will also not be distributed, as the creditors will not receive that payment from the debtor company unless the lenders of the creditors receive payment. This is unlikely to have happened or be near to happening.  This means the creditors still have an outstanding claim over the company and all lenders are owed money, which may only have been received by your company recently.  If the banks decided to cut the repayments at 20%, they were likely hoping for 100%, so they can't exactly give out 80% of what they aren't receiving. The creditors may have already received all payments owed prior to making the distribution.  In this case, the amounts they will distribute are just what the creditor doesn't have. Any of these are possible.  Either way it seems unlikely that you will be paid in full.  You have 2 claims, being the debt owed and the claims of creditor companies (which you mentioned).  Both are likely to only have partial payments. It's really unknown what the company is worth, and that's why this number may be unimportant.  The only certainty about it is that it would be negative, based on a reasonable assumption that claims are unlikely to exceed what was owed (and may be much lower than that).  Even if you were paid you would be getting 50%, or potentially less if you had an unsecured credit or if payments were distributed in different ratios."
[INST] Is it true that 90% of investors lose their money? [/INST],"Most individual investors are at a disadvantage compared to professional money managers. While individual investors would probably be better off if they didn't try to time the stock market, most would probably do better if they did try to time the market than if they tried to pick the best funds. Some professional money managers are more successful at timimg the market than many people would imagine. The key to stock buying and selling is understanding as precisely as possible when the price of anything you need to buy appreciates the most, and that's something even professional money managers don't know. For instance, if a fund manager believes that they can beat the market by investing in small cap companies, then they may be right in terms of average annual performance, but they could lose a lot in some individual years. One of the great advantages to investing in mutual funds is that most managers are not allowed to time the market individually. The fund manager may decide when to buy certain stock or a certain sector at certain points, but he doesn't sell or buy individual companies. Investing in a mutual fund protects you, as an individual, from losing too much over a long period of time, and also prevents you from making money too much over a long period of time. That's because it protects you from investing in the worst of the poor managers, thus bringing down the average returns, because a mutual fund can get rid of the worst poor performing managers, while a 401k would have to keep them for a few more years. In exchange for those protections, you also give up the potential to earn huge returns from really good managers. Even then, 90% of funds probably fail to beat the benchmark over a long period of time because of the high fees associated with active mutual fund management. There are some very good books that argue for mutual fund investing and explain the trade-off between different levels of fees. Some of it probably also has to do with the fact that some people do really well for a period, but then they either have to start doing it differently, have people looking for the same opportunities, don't realize they're doing something wrong, realize they're doing something wrong, start doing something else, or something along those lines. These would all be explanations for why an above average manager for a few years could end up with below average performance over 20 years, even if there's little if anything wrong with their investing, but they just don't do as well from here on out as they did in the past few years.","Yes, that may be true for the general population. There are 100s if not thousands of studies which will confirm this. If you only invest in individual stocks or mutual funds and do not take some of your profits and invest them in more shares of the mutual fund or stocks, then that is your fault for reinvesting in your losers. You should take profits and diversify your portfolio."
[INST] Can a company charge you for services never requested or received? [/INST],"In New York, a few decades ago, a woman was charged a $100 interest rate for borrowing some money from the payday loan place. Not a small amount when the actual loan amount was $5000. Her friend borrowed some money from the same place and had the same experience on that exact day.  The NYT reported the story. There was some outrage expressed, the legislature introduced a bill to stop the practice.  The story is found here.  http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/04/nyregion/a-new-york-payday-loan-charge-100-for-$500.html","Are you legally and/or financially obligated to pay? Your bank account. It isn't the money the bank is holding. It's their money. It doesn't matter whether they were ever paid. You should not have a bank account with that bank. That money was your money. You should sue the bank for holding your money, and possibly other things like misrepresenting your account. Even if you win, you've wasted a significant amount of your time and money. Find a new bank. If a company wants your business, it should go about getting it. Most likely you signed something to allow them access to your account. That was a mistake. Even if you didn't realize what you were signing, you shouldn't sign a contract you don't understand. If they don't want your business they should ask, give you an actual phone number to call, or hire someone who can answer the phone with at least a passing attempt to sound like they're a human. (The last I found was someone who just said ""Hey"" and then hung up.) If the money was supposed to be from PayPal then maybe contact them to see if they really do hold your money. If they don't, and you still have the money that you supposedly owed, pay it with no interest, no late fees. I doubt they will still claim it's owed, but if they want to be cheap, they might. Maybe explain the situation and ask for help. You don't owe anything. It was money you owed them."
