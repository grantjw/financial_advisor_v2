"<s>[INST] For a car, what scams can be plotted with 0% financing vs rebate? [/INST]","
If your credit unions offer financing on car loans (even up to the manufacturer's limit...), and you are already planning to buy an automobile that is less then that max amount, what options would you have for lowering your payments?

I know there used to be scams using rebates (and possibly others such as 0% financing) so that the dealer could charge more for the car. But is the credit union's interest rate based on the full purchase price? And if it is NOT interest rate based, can you find a credit union that would not only meet the manufacturer and your budget price/amount, but also charge the lowest possible interest rate (or at least a low interest rate)?

I have used the credit union's car loan calculator before and have found that I would need about $2,000 to $4,999 below MSRP (or the amount from the manufacturer for the car) to get a lower monthly payment, but I was paying a higher interest rate each month than I might have with other credit unions in different states.

How do I get the best interest rate and the lowest payment on a car while buying the car at a price I am comfortable with and have the money to pay for the car?"
<s>[INST] Why does it matter if a Central Bank has a negative rather than 0% interest rate? [/INST],"[INST] Central Banks are NOT just like other banks. They issue their own money in the first place. So having no or low interest rates (a lot cheaper than anyone else...) encourages speculators to play the game, and the Central Bank itself is a big speculator. This means the Central Bank can drive prices in the securities and other financial markets to extremely high levels. That makes the Central Banks more powerful because it makes everyone else, especially the big money markets, dependent on Central Banks. [/INST] [INST] In our current situation it matters more. The Central Banks are trying to prop up the financial and property bubbles again when they had already gone bust some years before. And in an effort to prop up those bubbles the European Central Bank (ECB) actually lowered its interest rates. [/INST] [INST] The European Central Bank does not have to do that. It is NOT a 'normal' bank. [/INST] [INST] The European Central Bank is a huge speculator in financial markets. It holds a lot of the financial assets in Europe: over 35% of the banks assets. [/INST] [INST] That's why the European Central Bank should be banned from playing financial markets, like every other speculator. [/INST]

#### How can that help the economy?

First off: no, Central Banks should NOT be in financial markets.

When the Central Bank is in financial markets all the others try to get them not to lose face.

The financial bubbles will be inflated again; that will prop up the banks, the stock exchanges and the property markets; the people working in those sectors with a vested interest.

Ironically, those big interests are the ones most interested in keeping the Central Banks in the game; not the other way around. So the banking system and the other financial market makers will try to get the Banks involved.

So first off, we have the interests of big international economic powers at odds with the interest of the population. They just love playing the casino.

Of course it is best to have the Central Banks out in a way that they do not get in trouble.

The financial interests and the political interests of the powers of the 1% may be at odds with the interests of the 99%.

So the 1% are very interested in keeping the Central Banks in the game. But the 99% should not try to keep the Bank in the game.

It is better to have the Central Banks out, when we want the benefits.

#### It is more likely when the Central Bank is not needed.

[INST] Secondly, the other banks will play and lose. All the other banks, and financial market players, including the property markets because property is just as much a financial asset as any other. They will speculate on what the Central Banks will do next: [/INST] [INST] - what asset will the Central Bank buy today? [/INST] [INST] - how much will the Central Bank pay and how much will it lend to anyone? [/INST] [INST] - who will the Central Bank buy, and not buy, from and to? [/INST] So when the Central Bank is not just another bank: [/INST] [INST] - the financial asset markets will be more chaotic because of the Central Bank than without. They will never be calm again in the financial markets. [/INST] [INST] - that will increase all kinds of problems to the financial market players. They all will be stressed about being propped up or not by the Central Bank. The more stress and competition, the more errors and frauds, and the larger the losses the markets and the players will make. The financial asset holders are speculators, not savers. They do not produce something of value for society. They are just a tax on transactions, which can be avoided in a free and just society.[/INST] But the stress causes all kinds of financial and other problems. The players in the markets will see that it is better to keep to the Central Banks, especially if they are the only ones in the game, and not the others. It is better for other banks to stay quiet, get along, and keep happy. That means, stay in line with the Central Banks. [/INST] [INST] When the Central Banks get involved, we have a very distorted world. The Central Banks will distort financial markets and the economies in a chaotic way and create more problems than they solve. [/INST]

#### When there is a negative interest rate, is that problematic?"
<s>[INST] Where should I be investing my money? [/INST],"

Many members will agree with me on this, that it's one thing to have money....

[INST]Where should I be investing my money? (1/10)

Many members will agree with me on this, that it's one thing to have money, and another thing to know how to make even more or where to invest to achieve that.

In the past few weeks i have looked at some investment opportunities and even visited places where i could spend some of the little money i have.

When i was growing up, i heard the term ""safe money""...i had heard that it means investment that one puts in the bank. Recently, a lady that i know told me something very interesting...that her family business had invested in a rice mill that would eventually bring them billions in the future.

So, i decided to ask some of my friends who are financially capable the kind of business they are involved in. Most of them gave answers that surprised me. A guy i know that has business in real estate told me that he had invested in stocks and that stocks was the future...so i decided to research on these things too and learn more about them."
