"[INST] For a car, what scams can be plotted with 0% financing vs rebate? [/INST]","I'd call this a 'scam' a lot less than calling it 'lying' because it's technically true. But in the finance world there is often an unspoken and sometimes even openly-discussed notion of 'we' vs 'them' regarding customers. They don't think you'll understand and you're being stupidly naive when you don't see their intentions as they see them. It's more like they feel they shouldn't have to tell you, you should just realize. But either way- that's the scam- not the deal, which is perfectly legal and common. The 'deals' I've run into have included things like extended warranties, pre-payment penalties and other items that you don't have much choice about. In your case, 'zero' interest is a lot tougher. That means they won't get any interest from the loan, so they get zero, but have to eat the cost of the financing- but they can get as many $2000 sales rebates as they want to give away as long as the loan rate and sale price are still favorable to their bottom line. And often these deals involve the fact that sales rebates are a big deal compared to the tiny effect it has on the loan. If a dealer offers you $100 for your down payment, they are essentially saying that they will finance $2500 if you pay another $2200 on top of the cash you already have. But as a practical matter, you might actually have the cash (or not) as a practical matter, or you may just not want to pay it- but the dealer can still take the offer if they want to give the rebate as part of the deal. There's no rule that says a rebate or the financing must include the other thing in the total price- and the deal is technically just as sound as if it included just one of them, and if you pay cash and take the rebate, they're taking a loss compared to if you had just paid cash with no rebate.","The only scams are related to the negotiation process.  If there is one deal where you know you are being low balled (0% financing only offers) and another deal where you know you are being low balled (low rebate and low financing offer) and you aren't a person with infinite patience to negotiate between the two deals, then you might get a different price by picking one or the other deal from those and picking the best deal. There is no reason that a car manufacturer wouldn't have rebates or financing for themselves.  Manufacturers have to make a profit somehow and they have to decide how much interest to charge on their financing or how much of a rebate to offer.  This will depend on many factors internal to the manufacturer themselves."
[INST] Why does it matter if a Central Bank has a negative rather than 0% interest rate? [/INST],"There are some differences between a negative interest rate and a zero percent rate. In a negative rate, your interest is charged as a negative number meaning you lose money from the loan. Whereas a zero balance loan means that interest is not accrued on that loan. These concepts are different because it represents whether you may lose or earn no further interest. That's another way to state the definition of the words ""negative,"" ""zero percent."" A negative rate signifies that you lose money from a loan. A zero percent rate means that there is no interest rate on that loan.","As a saver, I would rather have a negative rather than 0% interest rate, because  it means I can lend money for 10 billion dollars (negative interest rate of -10%), and have at worst 9 billion dollars back, because my bank can only be assessed interest on 9 billion dollars, not 10. If I was able to have a 0% interest rate on my savings of 10 billion dollars, then I would have to give back ten, and would be left with nothing."
[INST] Where should I be investing my money? [/INST],"You need some risk and some returns. If you invest in interest-bearing securities, you will be at the mercy of rate fluctuations but you will have a guarantee about the principal of the security. If you invest in the stock market or other equities, you will have to bear an uncertainty with regards to interest or return, but your principal will appreciate with the increase in your own equity positions. You can't get 100% return with zero risk. If there is an opportunity, there is a risk of loss too. If you put money in your savings account, you won't be getting a return but you will have your principal guaranteed. So, you have to first decide what you want: do you want the principal guaranteed (low risk) or higher return (high risk). There is also a question of liquidity and your time horizon. If you need to liquidate your stocks on a certain date, then you are buying illiquid stocks. I hope my answer is helpful.","This is a great question and is asked daily.. The two most important factors are your age and risk tolerance. In terms of age, the best way to evaluate is age by the amount of risk you are looking to take. I used to use this tool by Vanguard called the Investor Questionnaire Tool which would give you some recommendations depending on the answers you give. Another good way to evaluate your risk tolerance is to read your prospectus for the type of security vehicle you are looking to invest in. If it gives recommendations for certain risk levels of the vehicle, then you should invest within those risk levels.  My personal investment advice is to save first then pay yourself a percentage per year to use on investing once your emergency fund is built up. Then pay yourself again after each raise or bonus to invest. Once you start investing you may want to keep with low risk but keep investing. However after your expenses are met and you have saved your required emergency fund and are paying yourself to invest, take your age and invest. (e.g. you invest what your target allocation in the portfolio is and move from risky to conservative as you get older. I use the Vanguard asset allocation tool as suggested in the comments."
[INST] Specifically when do options expire? [/INST],"Many types of derivative contracts - including all varieties of options - have expirations.  Options exist in different time frames, but a basic time line might look like this: When the option contract is issued to the buyer, its time line will be detailed in the terms of the document defining the contract. Some options are perpetual, which means they never expire. If the only time line given is ""unlimited"" (eg. ""the option continues until canceled""), then the unlimited means it will remain in effect until they decide to get rid of it. This is a contract, so if the counter parties agree (eg. because you paid to have an ongoing agreement that continues until you cancel it) that's what you should expect. More common and perhaps safer are ""term"" options which have a fixed expiry but the option to choose the length of that date, usually with a cap on the expiration period (eg. it will expire by a number of business days such as ""on the last business day before 91 days have passed from the beginning of the contract"").","In the US a standardized option will expire in 3 business days after the stated expiration. As such an at the money January call option that expires on the 15th will not actually expire on the 15th.  It will expire at 11:30 P.M. eastern time, the day before (since business days also include Saturday). The other option is that some options expire on a special date such as the expiration month. In that case the expiration will be on the first business day after that date."
[INST] Negative Balance from Automatic Options Exercise. What to do? [/INST],"Call your broker (in this case TD Ameritrade) and tell them your case.  Have them do an FCC, Full Concurrent Collateral, between account(s), to transfer cash and/or securities  or both.  You are out nothing if you do. If no liquidation, you do that to get to a positive balance in your accounts.  Call TD Ameritrade and they will give you the instructions. Full Concurrent Collateral (FCC). With an FCC, you can transfer cash or securities from one   account to another account at TD Ameritrade: a margin or credit balance to a cash or   security balance, or a cash or security balance to a margin or credit balance, all   concurrently to the purchase, delivery of, or receipt of cash or securities. How it works. To execute an FCC, you supply the ID number of the account to receive the collateral, the type of collateral to transfer (security or cash), and the type of account transfer (partial or concurrent transfer). Partial Transfers When you choose a Partial FCC, our systems send a request to your custodian to transfer some, though not all, of the     requested collateral and deposit it in or deduct it from the receiving account. If you transfer a security, the custodian transfers the requested position to the   receiving account. If you transfer cash, your custodian debits or credits an amount equal to the   request. You will be responsible for the fees charged by both your custodian and TD Ameritrade for   executing the partial FCC.","The best thing for you to do is contact your IB regarding the issue. As I don't know who you are dealing with, I'm unsure if you can exercise an OCO but what I assume you can do is exercise the option and take the cash if you so desire. It will be reported as a cash trade for TAX purposes."
[INST] Approximation of equity value for company in default [/INST],"I'm unsure what you mean by the ""approximate financial value"" of a company in liquidation, but assuming you mean the total amount that would be given to the shareholders in the liquidation, I'd say that's very hard to approximate, especially when it comes down to the shareholders level, since there are many things that would drive the exact amount you would hope to get, such as the actual price of assets that might be liquidated, the tax that would be incurred and many other items. As we've seen in this case, the stock price (which was at $1.50) was not a good approximation of the company's value either.  Further complicating things is the fact that you probably need more than one liquidator and it is not a straightforward process.   I hope that helps. Good luck!","It would be a lot of work to try to figure out the net present value of future cash flows by modeling them one at at a time.  It would be easier to ask: are these cash flows ""unless we can get a bailout"" or ""even if we go bankrupt"" or ""because bankruptcy is declared immediately"".  And if the latter then the cashflows don't need to be discounted; if it applies they just need to apply whether bankruptcy is declared immediately or not."
[INST] Is it true that 90% of investors lose their money? [/INST],"In a post last September entitled 90%, I presented data showing that ""investors"" (as defined by the authors of this research) indeed lost money from 2007 to 2014, but there were other measures of success the investors could choose when choosing an investment vehicle. I'll review this post as I answer your question, and hopefully this helps clarify your question. First, it should be noted that ""the 90%"" claim doesn't mean a statistically significant 90% loss among all investors in all investment vehicles. This is why I prefer to define this 90% statistic: How far was the return on the investment below the return on inflation? In this context, we can see that 90% of the total of negative-return and low-returning investment vehicles were worse than having nothing but cash in your account. This is probably why Vanguard, a well-respected fund family, refers to the average investor earning the ""90%"" of the fund family's returns as investors who made bad decisions: The Vanguard founder once challenged the mutual fund industry to beat the S&P 500 index, and we were the first to accept. Since then, Vanguard has beat the general market's results with lower costs, which have created significant value over the long run for Vanguard investors. The fact is, however, that some investors will earn more than the returns that investors earn on average, and some will earn less. As shown in the chart above, 54% actually earned better results through 2014 than those who had a cash investment in 2007 and another 20% came close to those results. For your information, I'll show you my charts that I did back in December. I chose this date because 2015 was one year after the 2014 data, allowing 2015 to be considered a new year. I didn't update the title, so this is still showing that over six years, the negative-returning class had a 90% share of the total number of fund vehicles in this industry. That's still true for the ""1980 to 2015 period"" even with 2015 data. Here's a newer chart, looking at each industry, and showing the industry returns in a range of results. You can see that this 5 year period includes two recessions: The 2008-2009 recession and the recovery period afterwards, and some of the industries' returns were below the average. In each chart, the VIX is included for reference. This is commonly referred to as the ""wall of worry."" I find it interesting that all of these investors chose industry funds that ended up being down in 2009 with the other negative-performing ones!","2% of investors win 100%, but because 2% is very statistically insignificant of the whole they are classified as lose. But the majority of investors do indeed lose money especially if they trade on emotion, greed, or fear rather than on math. 90% is a number which comes out of the book, How To Make Your Millions in the Stock Market: You Are Only Eight Steps Away. If you look at that book's contents the book says those who do things a certain way will do one way and you'll win and those who do things a different way won't do as well and will end up losing. The book itself is not clear enough to explain why the 90% statistic came up but I'm sure it can be explained. In fact I remember seeing 97% of all investors lose money. I agree this can be misleading. However many people do lose money. The way to be in the top 10 percent for most markets would be to buy and hold. For investors who try to win in and out of the market it is much more difficult and it is not surprising to see them in the red. In the long term, investors will outperform the indexes because they use fundamental and technical analysis rather than buy and hold which will only make them average."
[INST] Can a company charge you for services never requested or received? [/INST],"If the money has been processed already, and the billing records indicate that the request has been confirmed; yes. If there is no confirming data (meaning that they do not know you bought product X and therefore you must have bought one of X,Y,Z - and they chose X), then either they don't have the software to detect that there is no associated order, you can request a refund. Otherwise there is a problem with the software that has not yet come to notice. If you have never bought product X and the order number (or a similar unique id) of the order is the same for all orders of this particular product, then they definitely know you have the product, are not trying to cheat you, and are merely incompetent. I presume you can have this confirmed either by their invoice or bank statement.","When a service is ""billed,"" it's typically with the understanding that you will pay the amount billed when you receive an invoice from the service provider. In this case the service provider has charged you but has not provided a bill (as evidenced by the fact that you did not ask what was billed in the first place). As such, most courts would rule that no service was provided and thus you are under no obligation to pay, unless there is a preexisting contract in place that states otherwise (like maybe you signed up for a certain service and agreed to prepay a certain amount for a certain amount of time).  In your case, it is clear that you have not prepaid for any service. Thus it would seem that whatever you were charged was fraud on the part of whoever charged you.   You should contact your bank to dispute the charge so that it comes out of their accounts (rather than you losing your cash from your account). You should also request your credit history and report this theft to the authorities."
[INST] Working out if I should be registered as self-employed in the UK [/INST],"Is there a minimum requirement at how many self-employment days you need to register yourself? Technically, no. A more relevant factor if the number of days you are actually working as a self-employed. As the HMRC self-employment information page, on the second tab, you will find the link asking ""How many days do I need to work to be a self-employed? I have a small business that runs 5 days a week and I am worried that some weeks I only work for a few hours. Am I still going to have to be a self-employed?"" There are more factors, such as your job and income from that job, that you might want to consider.","I think (but am not completely sure!) that the 'CIS' scheme only applies to contractors. If I am correct in that, then the first thing to say is that the fact that your agency requires you to use CIS is a strong indication that they do not operate under the minimum set of conditions to classify your role as being an 'employee', thereby making them liable under PAYE. If you would have been classified as an employee, they would have had to pay into the national insurance scheme and provide you with the full range of other employment benefits. I will be interested in feedback from others who know more detail about the requirements of PAYE on whether my interpretation of PAYE is correct. So there are two considerations here. 1) The classification of your role as being self-employed. This is a relatively simple process which you can do yourself (eg take a look at http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates-at-a-glance/self-employed/employment-state.pdf). If you were classified as an 'employee', then the agency would have to pay you and treat you under PAYE. 2) The classification of your role under 'CIS'. If you find that you do in fact have a role where you would be classified as an employee, but you are under 'CIS', there is a process for getting you re-classified as an employee, so that it is easier for you to calculate your tax etc correctly and the agency need only comply with PAYE. This is called an 'opt-out'. The CIS scheme requires that your agency deduct a 'minimum rate' of 20% for insurance etc. (it is called contribution and not tax since it is not tax). It also allows for a 'minimum rate' of a further ~2% for administration costs of the scheme, to be deducted. If the amount deducted is less than these percentages, then the agency must pay the remainder of the rates. If you were classified as employee, then your agency must pay all. Your agency should be able to explain why they use CIS as a means for making contractors pay the 'minimum minimum rate'."
[INST] About eToro investments [/INST],"First, I want to reiterate a note that @l [in the comments] brought up, because I have had some experience through a separate route but it does get confusing: eToro is in no way related to eTrade. These are two completely different companies. Now that that is out of the way, I can address the original question. According to this article, from what I can gather, the main advantage of eToro is that  you do not need an advanced education in finance, you can use eToro's system to see how other investors have made their trades, and then make the same trades. You can also get advice from eToro's ""staff"" if you pay for this service - but the article says that this ""team of analysts"" is not made up of very qualified experts, at best they are in my opinion akin to financial journalists offering simple, general advice.  I mention this because I think it is important to note that if you do not use the more advanced tools that eToro offers- the ones that allow you to copy other's trades, it doesn't actually offer significant advantages over an account with a discount broker like eTrade [as other's have suggested in the comments], other than the lack of fees charged by eToro. However, eToro's fees and trades that you can copy do make it cheaper than a non-discount stock broker [ie. eTrade or Scottrade] to buy these types of investments if a fee was all you are worried about - it is also faster. They also offer additional features in the form of newsletters from their team of analysts, trading tools including stop orders, limit orders, and stop-loss orders, etc.  There are other options for getting this type of access to the non-standard investments at lower fees however, including some discount brokers. Some have better features such as having more investment options available [there are options for certain financials], and can offer lower fees for trades for some more unusual securities [these trades are more complex than usual, so the broker's systems have to do more work to place the trades which increases the fee].  Also, a discount broker such as eTrade and Scottrade may charge a fee for copying one or more of the trades you make, but some of their more unusual features- specifically their stop order, stop-loss order, and limit order features are going to cost you regardless of whether or not you have purchased a stock through eToro or another source. The key difference seems to be that eTrade and Scottrade will not charge a fee to place your trades with them, just like if I made these trades as an individual, through their automated trading system, if you use their automated system. The reason that eToro works out significantly cheaper though, is that through the way that eToro prices these transactions and eToro sets the prices of the trades that you can copy. I will note that I have never personally used any financial products or services available through either eToro or eTrade. As always, do your own research. Also note that eToro is going to invest the funds that you sent them into a segregated account, and may not necessarily invest these funds into a product that directly matches the security that you have purchased.","You have to fund the account at least with the initial payment amount. You have $500 worth of the investment you selected as your first choice. You cannot invest less than $500 or you don't have at least $500 in your account. I recommend you read this document to make sure you understand what eToro does. There are a few different types of investments to choose from and I suspect the one you choose is a ""long position"" which you can hold onto for a period of time. As the time period ends, you should be able to sell off your portion of the ETF and receive the gains (or losses) that time period has produced."
