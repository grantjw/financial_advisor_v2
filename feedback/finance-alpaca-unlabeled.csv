[INST] Should I open a credit card when I turn 18 just to start a credit score? [/INST],"I would recommend opening a credit card. But first make sure you understand what you're doing. First, how will this affect your credit?  Opening credit card accounts in a short period of time is looked upon adversely and, therefore, will affect your ability to obtain credit for up to 2 years. Therefore, you want to spread out the opening of other accounts over a longer period of time before you open this one. Second, what other kinds of accounts are available to you?   Make sure that you shop around and are finding the best deal available.  It is very easy to spend money with a credit card and be surprised by the resulting interest owed. If you're getting the card with your debit card bank, make sure that the interest rates are very competitive and/or that there is no annual fee.  The APR on some debit credit cards varies from a minimum of around 9.99% to as high as 29%!  That's a very big difference. Another option is a Secured Credit Card.  It's a card that is secured with the funds in your checking or savings accounts.  The interest rates on this kind of card can be as low as 12.98%.  However, you're paying for that privilege. In the event that you don't pay your bill, they'll withdraw that same amount from the checking or savings account you used to secure it. In summary, opening an account is best for building your credit and securing your card is fine if you're planning on paying for every purchase and you need to build your credit. But before you decide, check the rates and find the best deal for your situation.","I would recommend having a credit card to help you establish credit, only if you can pay it off in full every month (i.e. only spend what you can afford.) Some cards have some really terrible interest rates, and you should avoid accruing extra interest.  Keep your credit utilization below 30%, and pay down any other debt you have and your credit will only go up.  If you get any other creditors (like a car payment, or any other major purchase), keep all of those accounts as positive as possible.  Once your score is at a decent level, start opening more accounts and then close them.  Also, keep your accounts, even if they have a high balance, open, and closed accounts are a factor. If you aren't worried about your future or your credit history, by all means, go and pay it off in full anyway, but make sure it's the right card for you.  You don't want an annual fee, which will negate any positive effect this card will have on your credit.  In the end, this is just more of a piece of advice that may or may not be needed, and one factor of many that makes up a credit score, which I, personally, find interesting. Good luck! :D"
[INST] Why do shareholders participate in shorting stocks? [/INST],"The purpose of a short sale is to sell a security without owning it, in hope of profiting on the price decrease, and closing the difference and pocketing the profit. To do this successfully one would need to have a margin account or a short selling (also a margin) account of which to borrow the shares.  And by ""borrow"", you're implying the actual number of shares exist somewhere, that in fact the other short sellers haven't sold them to you already and taken the money to go invest.  You'd also need to have a margin balance available to cover the interest that would have come due for the borrowed shares.  Otherwise they would not loan you the shares, as you would have a 100% margin balance and a short position all at the same time with no interest paid. Thus shareholders do not participate in short selling of security - it's not a free lunch they are giving you.","The shareholder lending the shares to the short seller does not need to accept those shares as collateral, that is he is not obliged to accept the shares as payment in the case of default.  His only financial risk is if the short seller fails to return the shares on the date of settlement  If he does return them then the shareholder is in the same position as they have the cash from the deal, so whether he has the shares or not, that is not relevant.   His only financial risk is if the stock price is below the strike price and the short seller does not make an interest payment. In return for lending the shares, the borrower pays a fee.  This fee is usually a % of the shares loaned (as % and not in cash).  Why should I take my cash and buy the shares back instead of doing what my customer does and sell and return the shares? If I'm the shareholder, I'd rather get the money and use it to buy better stock, or sell the shares to somebody else."
[INST] Why do card processing companies discourage “cash advance” activities [/INST],"It's because the credit card industry is trying to get away from being a credit provider to being a provider of ""payment"" solutions. The days of banks providing ""payment solutions"" are rapidly coming to an end, and the credit card industry is trying to take it's place. You see, by providing ""payment solutions"", people will use cards more, and as such it will cost more for people to pay for things using cards, and as such the credit card companies will have more money coming in. The problem with this business model as long as ""cash advances"" are allowed is that people can basically get around paying interest by just withdrawing money via ""cash advance"" from ATMs. Because it can take 1-2 billing cycles for the interest charges to hit your bill, you can basically end up with a ""free"" loan from your credit card company, and that is a problem for them - unless you actually pay off the ""cash advance"" before you are charged interest on it.","There are a few reasons but I assume one of the biggest reasons is that they will have to pay the merchant the processing fee without getting paid from the cardholder and then they have to send the cash to you. I can't think of anything else they will have to pay to other parties involved too, but that's one reason why cash advances are heavily discouraged. In some places, the card issuing bank can even charge $10 to $30 dollars and interest on cash advances and that will only further discourage this behavior."
[INST] Is dividend included in EPS [/INST],Dividends included in EPS. Net Income/Shares outstanding (Dividends paid) should result in a number less than the 'true' earnings per share since dividend is paid out.,"The EPS is the money that has been paid out to you (and therefore subtracted from your net worth) plus the money that would accrue to you at current market price. Consider Apple as an example: at the end of 2013, Apple had $12.24 per share, but if you were a shareholder, you would receive $18.41 per share. The price of your stock is your investment. You get to subtract the cost of that, and take a profit or loss based on whether the current price is above or below what the company is currently distributing to you. To sum up, the EPS includes the dividends paid. You can calculate the dividends yourself by calculating the current stock price. Here's a quick example from Apple's 2013 report:"
[INST] Where should I park my money if I'm pessimistic about the economy and I think there will be high inflation? [/INST],"There are funds such as HCM, which invests in tangible assets such as gold, silver and other commodities.   The idea is this:   If the value of the dollar declines/the dollar loses its value, the value of the investments in the fund should increase.   If this fund has performed poorly over the past few years, it might be because the dollar has been weak so this type of investing (a bet against the dollar) has not been profitable.","Inflation might not have been the best word to use. Inflation is used when the value of currency drops. What you meant was that you believe that we might move to some form of global currency, or that you believe that in general the national currency might weaken. A good bet might be a government-issued treasury bond. Most likely, a long-term one. Another option might be physical gold or silver."
[INST] Why would analysts recommend buying companies with negative net income? [/INST],"While there might be good reasons for the company to take on debt or be in a negative income generating situation, there are also some other reasons that such companies are undervalued or perceived to be undervalued. One such reason would be that the firm is considered to be a good opportunity for ""event driven investors"". While this may sound like a fancy way for calling these investors by a different terminology, such investors in general consider their investments based upon a certain news related to the company e.g. M&A, spin-offs, dividend, asset acquisition, etc. There are multiple studies of these investors. One such one done by G. Bamber, N. Ghose, S. Schmitt, and J. Yasuda that appeared in July 2007 (http://www.nber.edu/papers/w12911) found among other things that companies on the I-Banking buy-side list do not produce significantly better returns than the broad market once controlling for book-to-market and size do. It is also important to note that their sample period was from 1999 to 2004 and the study was done in the months preceding the crash of 2008. Such investors are not only more sensitive to the news and market noise but there has also been evidence that the ""quality"" of the news, as the companies themselves would like the investors to appreciate, such as analyst's recommendations have been found to have significantly less information of a positive nature than any other negative news item such as a management change, a reorganization, or a spin off.  One can safely say that analysts usually do not do a very thorough job at valuing debt or at least do not have the tools to see exactly under which scenario the company would start generating positive cash flow. One such piece of software that tries to solve the valuation problems of companies using debt is the ""net income"" feature on Dividend.sg (http://dividendsg.com). This is a tool the authors are working on over 6 years and it tries to address the valuation problems of companies that may look unattractive in their current state. The valuation is done based upon the company's historical operating cash flow and an ""estimate"" of the current operating margins, a scenario in which the operating margins would reach their historical average levels, etc.","There are a lot more things to make your decision to buy or sell a security then what the company is selling.   The bottom line is simply the point of many financial statements to summarize the financial position at a point in time.   These do not really illustrate any potential future earnings or trends.  The only thing that they do is demonstrate that they are at odds with the current accounting standards and will have to restate their earnings as such. I always consider any bottom line number as suspect.  The bottom line is never at the top of my checklist when making a buying or selling decision. There are many other statements that should be viewed before making any decision.  They include  Income Statements which show net income, cost of goods sold, sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, which all give potential investors a feel for the health of the company they want to invest in.   Balance sheets which show assets and liabilities as compared to the last period, showing how this affects the liquidity and solvency of a company, which in turn will provide a company to stay in business.   Cash Flow Statements which provide a comprehensive measure of cash available to the company and potential to the company. In my opinion, Net Income is one of the most misleading metrics of a company."
[INST] Why would people sell a stock below the current price? [/INST],"It could simply to the case that this particular person wanted to take their profit at that moment and doesn't necessarily want to wait, or that a big purchase of or sale of the stock just occurred somewhere downstream of the market's order book (say in another country's market that doesn't trade a lot compared to what's transacting in the US) and the price has to settle down the global market order for that particular stock.  In either case, it really doesn't change the company's value; the person selling doesn't care what the stock's price changes to afterwards other than as a measure of profit or loss, and the buyer buying it does care (although generally not as much as the seller), but neither of them have power over the price.",No shares on the market to sell.  If you have a million shares on the market and sell 100k now you still have 1 million shares but 200k less shares you expect to sell at a higher price.  This would drive up the price.  If you buy 100k your share price drops.  If you have too many shares to move in the block or can't find any at the price you are willing to pay you drop your bid.
[INST] Conservative ways to save for retirement? [/INST],"I think that the best way to save for retirement is with a tax sheltered retirement savings account. The one that fits in the US seems to be the Traditional 401(k) or IRA. You are allowed to make contributions to a 401(k), in most cases a percentage of your salary, and you won't have to pay income tax on that. I have a Solo 401(k) retirement account through Vanguard that is my main investment account and where I save for retirement. The minimum contribution, like most retirement vehicle, is low as it is based off of salary, so $50. I do contribute the max as the 401(k) plan is tax deductible. For example, this year I qualified for the maximum contribution of $18,000 which comes to around $1,498 a month. I contribute most of my earnings to the retirement account so I really don't notice any tax issues in my day to day finances. If I want to make a ""splurge"" purchase, I just pull money out of my non-retirement accounts such as a savings account. (Note, you can only fund your Traditional 401(k) and IRA by automatic payroll withdrawal or money market deposits. All of the best investment options are through funds and cannot directly accept deposits or withdrawals. If you have the money to invest and wish to direct into a stock exchange, you will need another account to act as a cash account to perform the buying and selling, and the money for that will be taxed as income.)

I will add that you should know what type of an index you are investing in, so you know the underlying investments you are putting your money into. Some options: https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/3775.pdf  https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/content/why_invest_why_index_funds.html  http://www.thebalance.com/index-funds-for-retirement-options-5005502   I am using Vanguard as an example here as they were my preferred choice at the time of this edit (due to their low costs and reputation) I am not in any way endorsing this particular company for you.  It's just that it will give you a general idea of what you can expect.  Do additional research if you choose to go a different route."
[INST] What should my finances look like at 18? [/INST],"It's good that you are trying to take control of your finances, but it looks like you are trying to plan the future on limited information. As 18 year olds we make grand plans. As we get older, we recognize that life has a way of changing (even as we try to stay resolute).  My personal philosophy is to plan for the ""what ifs"". I may plan to pay $1500 a month to live a ""certain lifestyle"", but I won't plan on always living that lifestyle.  I think you should set yourself up to not worry about money. You've listed income as one side of the balance sheet, which is great. However, you've neglected to note your expenses.  First, you should have a basic budget, noting living expenses (rent/mortgage, electricity, water, etc), transportation (car payment), debt obligation (student loans), and entertainment/recreation (everyone needs to have some enjoyment in life). These basic expenses will help you to see where you are right now, and that will help you start your first plan. The plan should take into account things like, how much do you want to make as an over-all income goal. Once you know your current monthly obligations, how much will you need to take in (assuming you plan to spend all of your take home pay on these items?) and then plan for savings. These are just a few of the things to consider. Some of these are necessary for any reasonable plan, others are more subjective, like how much to save. For example, should you pay of student loans before you start saving to buy a car, house, etc. It's tough to plan for what's going to be 10 years from now, so that's why I suggest focusing on today's needs and what to plan to accomplish in say 3-5 years.  Good luck, you are definitely on the right path.","The first thing I recommend is that you need to define your values. Why do you want to have the big paycheck? Do you do it for yourself, or for your family, friends or coworkers? If you want a big paycheck in life, and if you're willing to do the work, a college degree is probably the best tool you can get. You may find you get more satisfaction out of living well, rather than getting that big paycheck.  So the first thing I'd do is define your goals - what is most important to you in life? What do you want out of life? How do you want to live? How do you want to use your time and money? What do you want to accomplish? What do you want to share with your family, friends and others? What do you want to give back? What are you not willing to do? What will you sacrifice to achieve what is important?  Once you figure that out, you'll better understand your financial needs. Your next thought is what do I want in the short term? You're young and the future is much more important than the present. You don't know what you want in the future, that's OK. Start by writing down your goals - 2 month, 3 month, 6 months, a year, and then do a long term goals ( 2 years, and 5 years).  Now it's time to organize your finances by creating a plan: 1. Create a budget for 2 months and 6 months. A budget is a record of all your income and expenses. Start by making two budgets. One budget for 2 months and one budget for 6 months. List your expenses, starting with necessary things first. Rent is necessary, groceries is necessary, utilities are necessary, etc. Make sure you have a separate category for wants like eating out, movies, entertainment, etc. The important thing is to stay on track with your budget. You can be flexible with things until you hit your short term goals, then stick to your budget no matter what. 2. Look for passive income. How can you make money in the future that won't require work? Look for investments now. Pay attention to what your parents are doing, if you don't want to ask it may teach you what not to do in the future. In the short term you'll need to have a plan for managing your expenses every day. You could try creating a budget right now, see if you can stay on track with it for 2 to 3 months. Then update it as needed. There is one important piece you should keep from your parents - a savings account. 3. Start an emergency fund. You need to know what life without a job would be like, in case it happens. You want to save 6 months of your normal living expenses. This is not a savings account, it's an emergency savings account. Make it a high interest account so you can't use the interest to live off of for fun things. 4. Prepare for the future. You will have to retire someday. It might not feel like you need to save for retirement now, because what's another 40 years of work right? The reality is that social security won't support your current lifestyle when you retire. We don't know what social security will look like in 40 years, so preparing for retirement now will make your future much more comfortable. Do the math - how much do you need? Can you invest now and get 10% back? What can you save for the future, now? If you need to ask for help or advice you can read the book ""The Automatic Millionaire"" by David Bach. It's not the only book on the market, but it's a popular one and many people like reading it. 5. Learn about debt. Do you have credit card debt? If you had no debt right now where would that money be instead? Do you have any loans that you pay monthly? If you're lucky, those will get paid in less than 10 years and cost you less than $30,000. If you weren't paying back a debt right now, could you make more than $30,000? Can you make $1,000 a month, with no debt? 6. Buy life insurance. I recommend that everyone at least buy term life insurance. It's a big safety net in case of emergencies in your future. If you have to drop out of college, are you prepared to survive for your next 40 years? You need something to help your future lifestyle stay the same, if possible, or at least maintain the standard of living."
[INST] Alternative means of salary for my employees [/INST],"I would recommend talking to your accountant or your Payroll Service provider. I don't know the laws in Australia, but I do know that in the US salary and wages are subject to various taxes.  Payroll taxes which include social security, medicare and unemployment.  You also pay federal and state taxes on that income that the employees are paid. There are other taxes you pay, such as sales tax if you get reimbursed for business expenses.  If you sell goods, income tax on your sales, and more.  Every payment to employees costs you money.   Why is it important?  Because that money you are spending on the employee pays a salary, not an interest rate. The bank is charging an interest rate for the money you are using for the salaries and wages.  You owe an interest rate for using the money. If you pay cash from your own account, you are not paying bank charges.  Those charges, known as interest, is just additional costs to pass on from you as the bank, to the borrower.  A borrower is anyone that receives cash in exchange for performing services or providing goods.  You are borrowing cash from your savings account.  They are charging you interest for the funds you borrow. Why is it important to tell your accountant?  The government takes a look at your income, expenses and taxes.  They make assumptions on where that money is coming from and how the expenses are generated.  To get the correct tax deductions you need to show them the actual process so they can allocate the expenses properly. If you are giving your employees checks with money drawn from your business savings account, then you are paying cash for those services.  If the expenses are part of the business, then your accountant has to make sure the government is collecting the correct taxes.  When you use a Payroll Service, they automatically make sure the taxes get paid.  When you tell your accountant that you are paying $1000. The accountant assumes you are paying the employee $1000.  If you do that in an unrelated transaction, then the money gets classified differently.  This makes it difficult for the IRS to properly track your money when they are auditing your taxes. Your Payroll Service provider takes care of all of this for you.  They pay the taxes into the appropriate accounts for you.  It takes the stress away from you.  This allows you, as an entrepreneur, to focus on your business.","You can't make them be in this form.  If you would only like to pay them in this form then offer them a job for an ""independent contractor"" and not give them any benefits or insurance.  Or better yet make the minimum wage and then give them a 1099 instead of a W2 for a 1099 employee as the minimum wage should be for an IC. The only other option is to revert to paying them like you do now."
[INST] Why is it not a requirement for companies to pay dividends? [/INST],"There is no legal requirement for a company to pay dividends in the USA. However, the 1933 Act does require the company to meet certain standards before they can issue shares and sell stock to the public.  This act includes quarterly financial reporting standards and limits to the number of issued shares.  The issue of dividends would therefore fall under these standards as many companies are paying them quarterly too.  I know some companies used to pay dividends annually or semi-annually.  If they don't have a history of quarterly dividends, but the board of directors did declare an annual or semi-annual amount, this would have to appear on the books within six months after the appropriate quarter.  The Board of Directors and company would make other statements within the quarterly financial reports about paying dividends and their plan for this.  If a company chose to pay dividends, the process would be the same. As mentioned in another question, the Board of Directors determine the dividends.  They usually make this decision based on annual or quarterly reports.  There are legal and tax requirements in the USA (most states) that require a certain amount of assets to be available when dividends are declared.  However, even if no funds were available, the Board can still declare dividends with a ""withholding"" that is the amount of the funds that can be used to declare dividends within a time period.  The Board can also change their mind on declaring the dividends.","It is not a requirement, because the shareholders can decide to reinvest their dividends.  That means the company can keep money on their balance sheets instead of pay it out. It also means that if a dividend is paid out, there is a lower amount of free cash available to reinvest in the company or to buyout other businesses.   There's also a balance to be struck to not pay too much in dividends, to keep some in case other investments become available. There is also the need to keep some in case the market falls, because if a stock is priced low and then you pay out a dividend, it could mean the dividend amounts to a fairly large fraction of the share price."
[INST] Why do stock exchanges close at night? [/INST],"Stock exchanges have a long history that reflects how they evolved.  For much of its history, physical brokerages (not electronic exchanges) sold their clients the shares of a particular company for a price of their choice, a process called a ""stock subscription"".  The selling prices were negotiated, the shares traded without any central recordkeeping, and stock was not even transferable (except through the broker) until the late 19th century.  This arrangement could lead to brokers inflating prices through a variety of mechanisms, and it was ripe for corruption and manipulation.  This is why the term ""Wall Street Gangsters"" persists to this day.   The NYSE (and other exchanges like it) were set up to formalize this process.  You can sell shares by submitting an order for a particular price and number of shares to the NYSE.  If your order is matched immediately, the trade is executed.  If it is not matched immediately, the order is entered into the order book, and you will get notified if (and when) your order is matched.  This order book is the ""exchange"" aspect of the stock ""exchange"". Once your order is matched, the NYSE records it as a trade by date, time, buyer, seller, price, and number of shares and updates its records accordingly.  The NYSE does not hold the physical shares themselves, you would not get a physical certificate in the mail or anything like that.  When your order gets matched, the shares are credited to your account, and your broker gets the money.   So, what's the point of the NYSE?  Why use them instead of using our broker?  Well, an important part of modern stock exchanges is that they are required to be as fair and objective as possible, so the NYSE (and other exchanges like it) cannot know or deal in any sensitive financial information or use it in any way other than to guarantee that the trade is executed.  If the NYSE knew or could use this information, it would have a very strong incentive to exploit it to its advantage, and that would ruin the exchange.  Therefore, the exchanges are (and must be) legally bound to only accept order information that can be made public and to execute them according to the terms set by everyone on the exchange. When the financial crisis began in 2007-2008, one of the first steps taken by the government and financial institutions was to create electronic exchanges.  Before then, physical brokerages (like Goldman Sachs) were more prevalent, and you submitted orders to them via telephone, fax, or a messenger.  You could even submit orders in person.  The only reason to accept orders until then was because of the logistics of paperwork.  However, electronic orders could be processed much faster. In general, all that an exchange does is take your order information, process it, and match it against other orders.  All of this would be possible without a central physical location.  This is why there are now multiple electronic exchanges.  They are essentially virtual exchanges; they only have a central website and customer service number.  You could theoretically execute a trade without ever having had any direct contact with them. One disadvantage to electronic exchanges is that there are no physical records of orders to match against.  If another trader believes the exchange has been tampered with, one recourse is to check the physical evidence.  With electronic trading, that is no longer possible.  However, with the advancements in cryptography that have been made throughout the 20th century, a tampered system could be detected.  Additionally, the log files used in trading would be much more secure, and they could theoretically remain the same whether executed electronically or physically (even if physically executed, they still have to be entered electronically eventually).  With electronic exchanges, however, they can never be as secure as they could be with physical records. Now, all of the above is a description of how physical exchanges operate, which is how the first ones were created.  Exchanges (especially electronic ones) have since evolved.  Some exchanges are simply the order book of a particular exchange, and not directly connected with it.  Others do everything from order taking to matching to trading. Many of these exchanges (including electronic ones) allow you to submit order data on their website or electronically, but the stock exchanges (including electronic ones) themselves do not do anything to actually process those trades, but simply maintain the trade information for historical and reference purposes. One of the disadvantages with this is that the orders are not processed until someone else sells or buys your stock at the price you set (i.","The financial district would only be open for so many hours a day. With advances in technology there may well be a point where it is possible to offer continuous trading. However, it is my understanding (forgive me I am not from a background in finance) there are other considerations such as the legal framework under which the exchanges would like to exist. I think it is also a matter of risk. Given the exponential growth in the volume of transactions on the financial market continuous trading could lead to a number of problems.

[INST] What is the opposite of a sunk cost? A “sunk gain”? [/INST],"In investing, sunk costs are not really all that relevant. In terms of investments you can look at what a specific investment is, compare it to the rest of your portfolio, compare its price and projected earnings to what you expect of the rest of your portfolio, etc. and make a decision on which would be more profitable.  Sunk costs can also work out in your favor; for example:  You bought some shares in company X from a company that was in trouble, and you got the stock really  cheap because everybody else was selling off their shares. You held on to them after everybody else had given up and sold their shares, and they started to go back up in price.  So, now they're much higher than when you got them. But you're still holding on to them; would it be smart to sell them?   In that scenario it would be better to hold on to those shares and take the gains from them, in terms of the gains, than to sell them now when you could make more gains from them in the future.  If you can, do.","While there are others, I believe you are asking about ""sunken costs"" vs. ""opportunistic costs"". If so, then:  Opportunistic cost refers to the lost business from not taking the contract. You are more familiar with the sunk cost which is the money you have already invested, so you don't walk away when things are not looking good on the profit trail.  In a small business it is very common for an owner to consider the opportunity and the risk that they will regret their choice.  With sunk costs at all times.  At first the sunk costs may be nothing since the business did not make any sales. Once you have a few sales, you may need to rent or build a display area to show off your product - creating additional sunk costs."
[INST] What is a Master Limited Partnership (MLP) & how is it different from plain stock? [/INST],"A Master Limited Partnership or MLP is a special entity created to hold a common interest in the energy business. The MLP shares are divided into units, where each unit being similar to the common stock of the MLP, with the difference that unit is comprised of common stock of the MLP and interest in the real estate of the master limited partnership, thus making the dividends of the MLP partially tax exempt, and allowing the company to deduct in the income tax the percentage of the property that is considered real estate, rather than the entire company.  In addition, MLP shares tend to be more risky than stocks, considering that they are subjected to changes in commodities, changes in the income of the company due to tax deductions and also to variations in the prices of common stocks if this type of business is affected by certain factors. All these considerations are necessary to analyze this type of business for investors looking for stability and high dividends and profits. The MLPs have a complex structure, which is mainly responsible for tax deductions, and it is also very hard to evaluate due to the fact that this type of business changes tax obligations throughout the years.  The MLP structure is mostly a combination of common stock and the tax treatment of partnerships. A master limited partnership consists of two basic components: the partnership and the publicly registered partnership interests traded on a national securities exchange. The entity that creates the partnership is a general partner, which is responsible for the partnership's business activities and operations, while the other group that holds a direct or indirect interest in the partnership is the limited partner, who just invests money without having the same obligations that the general partner has. The MLP is a publicly traded, so it is important to differentiate it from the MBS which is a type of security or financial instrument, whose value is derived from the underlying asset and the income collected.","An MLP is a type of business. An MLP combines a pass through entity with a limited partnership. The pass-through entity is typically a C-Corporation or an LLC taxed as a corporation (S-Corp, Sub S, or L-LCO). If an individual partner in the MLP sells their ownership interest, he/she will owe capital gains tax on the difference between the selling price and purchase price, but will not be subject to self-employment tax. He/she will be subject to self-employment tax on annual distributions of profit.  (For simplicity, let's assume all the partners' ownership interest in the MLP was purchased at the same cost with the same basis.) If the MLP sells an asset that has appreciated in value, the individual partners will owe capital gains tax on their share of the gains. This tax will be in addition to the self-employment tax for the distribution of profit.  The MLP tax incentives are meant to encourage ownership of infrastructure (pipelines, storage tanks, oil wells, etc.), and it provides a tax advantage in certain situations. An individual partner can deduct their share of the losses of the MLP to the extent of their share of the basis against their salary income, but any loss greater than the partner's share of the MLP's at-risk capital will be carried forward to subsequent tax years.  An MLP is attractive to many investors. The tax advantages allow the MLP to pay less in dividends, while the partnership structure lowers their investment risk. This can provide an advantage to an MLP when competing for oil or gas reserves."
[INST] How come we can find stocks with a Price-to-Book ratio less than 1? [/INST],"Book value means ""this is the most liquid asset value of the stock"".  The stock may sell at a price lower than book value when the future earnings of the stock are not worth that book value.","I suspect the reason is to be sought in the financial press and in the actions of analysts and the company in question – the company’s PR people probably want their stocks to look attractive. Price to book value per share is the ratio of market value of a company’s assets to its net shareholder’s equity, or the company’s net worth. Companies generally don’t have negative equity to start with, but it does happen. This is a rare case in which a merger leaves stock market equity exceeding the value of the firm’s balance sheet equity; the former value gets subsumed into the current owners’ stakes in the new company.  If this isn’t what’s happening in this case, the explanation lies elsewhere."
[INST] Why should one only contribute up to the employer's match in a 401(k)? [/INST],"If by ""the match"" you mean 100% (i.e. the employer matches your entire contribution dollar for dollar), then yes you would want to contribute up to the match.    However, in case you mean a less-than-100% match, your situation changes a bit. If your company matches 50% of your contribution, you might want to invest more than the match, but your best move is also dependent on what they do with the ""other"" 50% of your contribution. Many companies will ""put you in the S&P 500"" or something similar, not actually matching your contribution (i.e. your contribution is a transfer to your own retirement account, and the company is investing 50% of those in something else).   If your contributions are going into a retirement account managed by your employer, you may not have much control over the 50%. You may want to call their HR department and ask about this. You should figure out exactly where your contributions are going.","You should also be aware that any gains made in your 401(k) can't be tax-free for another 15 years (age 57 for many, you might be older before you can consider withdrawing what will grow into millions.)  In the meantime, you are missing out on all the money you could be making in a regular account, and you pay a high price (taxes) for investing that money.  Unless you've got that $8,896 in investment that you can put into the 401(k), or that money will go into your 401(k) to reach the matching limit (and you are not already over the regular contribution limit), you should skip the 401(k) and put them into a regular, tax-free savings account (CD, money market, or ETF/index fund).  That will serve you much better in the long run. If you need help on the mechanics of how to invest and make yourself money from this money so you can make it grow faster than inflation, ask in another question."
[INST] Why do banks finance shared construction as mortgages instead of financing it directly and selling the apartments in a building? [/INST],"The banks in Australia are very wary about any type of investment property loans.  We have had the financial collapse in the US that saw the downfall for many banks and investment firms.  Now our banking has become extremely stringent on investment property loans. What is causing the problem is most loan officers are unwilling to have an investment property in their loan portfolio.  Meaning you cant find a loan officer willing take a chance on your construction loan.   If we have a banking officer that is willing to take a chance on what is an unlikely construction loan, their employer is asking ""Does this person have their mortgage license?""  Which means a licensed loan officer can only lend out residential property loans.  Meaning you will have a hard time getting a banking officer who has the correct license to make your construction loan. In short, the banks are unwilling to take investment property loans.","There are a few possible reasons: First is that construction loans are usually quite short term -- a year or less.  During the year, not much equity will have been created.  The bank must foreclose, then take over control of the property and manage it.  Then sell it, often at a loss.  This puts more risk on the loan office's balance sheet, a risk many banks are reluctant to take.  If the bank were to sell shared construction before the year is up, that would require foreclosure.  That would cause them the same problem.  So instead the bank chooses to wait until there is substantially less risk of foreclosure. Another problem of the bank is that the construction must be finished within a year.  This can be hard to do.  For instance, if you get most of the materials and labor, and then you get a loan denial because they said there wasn't enough equity accumulated, that's bad.  You have to get the materials and labor back.  It could be that they have to go back into the market for a cheaper deal, which will take more than a year. Again, you want to have 80% equity after paying for all the materials, labor etc.  (80%, usually the maximum the bank will loan on). So you start with the total cost, and then the bank will loan you 80% of it, and you pay 20% of the cost.  That means you'll need materials and labor worth 25%. So even if they got you a loan, there is no way you could pay for that 25%.  Not right away anyhow, but they expect you to do that.  It would be a waste of their time and resources to loan them money they couldn't pay back. So you just borrow money from them that covers costs and you buy from them.  That would put you way behind in payments, and when it finally went to them, it would likely already be in foreclosure.  This is an expensive practice for the bank, so it costs the borrower money in the end. A third problem is that it would be impractical for the bank to sell the apartments.  That would just create more trouble.  You'd have some apartments rented, and others not.  You'd have some apartments that are up to code, and others not.  You'd have some finished, and some not.  You'd only be able to sell one apartment after another as they finished everything.  That would also be a hassle for the bank to deal with managing all that.  There's a better way. These are just some possible problems I can think of, that may differ from the problems of your loan officer.  Every loan is a little bit different.  Some of these problems could apply to many loans though."
"[INST] Transfer $50k to another person's account (in California, USA) [/INST]","The short version of this answer: Transfer the money between a bank in which both can have their funds in.  (In both banks accounts).  Transfer 25K each into their respective accounts.  If you are in the US go to the nearest check cashing store, and transfer a check between the both of you for $50000.  It is important, if they cash the check - you have the money in the other account.  The check can have either your name or their name.  This should not take much longer than 10 minutes to achieve.  Just sign the back of the check and transfer the funds into their bank account. Alternatively you could have them come here to the bank and fill out the paperwork to cash the check.  (If it is a large enough check I suggest this method).  But if its for a small amount, you could have them open an account here and do the check cashing that way, just know that it will take longer and cost more paperwork. Either way, you should be able to get the funds transferred in about 3-5 business days.","You need to file a gift tax return.  You are allowed to claim a $13,000 exemption per person.

[INST] Why do put option prices go higher when the underlying stock tanks (drops)? [/INST],"Consider three scenarios as to how you could profit from a sudden drop in price: If you think the drop will be sustained and the price of the underlying stock will not recover for a while, you should take the first step and exercise whatever puts you hold. If you decide to take your profit selling the puts in the market, you can take your money and go home. If you think the sudden drop could be only a short blip in the price of the stock, rather than a turn in a long-term trend, you might want to hold and wait for the price to recover to where it was before the sudden drop.  However, if the drop is only a momentary fluctuation, there is no guarantee that the stock's price will suddenly snap back to where it was even immediately before the drop.  The probability of a sudden rise back up is highest if the price of the underlying stock is moving toward some significant value.  Consider that if you were to exercise the options now, then you'd be taking their intrinsic and time values and converting them into the value of the stock.   What you're seeing is the market giving you a greater chance that the drop will be sustained - and hence that the price of the stock will be lower in the future - by giving you a higher intrinsic value on the puts.   If you do take the first step and exercise as you believe the price will continue to go down, you might be disappointed, because you're locked in at your exercise price no matter what happens later on.    Consider a put option for $20 expiring next month, with the underlying stock trading at $21.  The intrinsic value is $1 and the time value is about $0.40 on your put. You exercise this and get 100 shares. Suddenly the price of the underlying stock goes to $15, and the puts start trading for over a dollar. You might think you've gotten a great deal; you just paid $10 for each share of the stock.  However, because you're locked into that price, consider the fact that if the stock went right back up to $21 immediately the put option would be worthless (assuming your options were American style).  So now if the price of the stock suddenly shoots up - for no reason other than the short lived volatility - you can't take advantage and get a quick profit; you're stuck holding the shares.   Also consider that the option traders don't know the market is likely to go back up, only you do, so they would probably have to be convinced that the market is about to go up before their options would be of any interest to you.  If they think like you do, and the price of the stock still trades at $15, then you could get stuck with your stock, because the puts might be worth a dollar or more, and you'd be spending more than a dollar to get each share of the stock and have no interest in buying it because you believe the stock is heading lower.","The risk of an investor exercising the put option is at an all time low following a drop in the stock price. That lowers the value of the put option and increases the price. If the stock price stays low, the price of the put option will stay high because the probability of exercise is likely to stay high. Suppose the option is worth $0.50 when ABC goes from $20 to $19 a share. Its price would probably decrease if ABC went even lower, in order to discourage investors from exercising the option while the price is at a long term low in the near future.  If ABC goes back up, the probability of exercise decreases as the price increases, the riskier it seems to exercise early, and the cheaper the put option. This is one reason why companies like Google use the put option as a tactic to keep employees from selling too soon after an IPO, and why companies buy back their own shares in order to increase the price of the share in the market. It's also why insiders or those at the company may be tempted to take out put options. Another way of looking at the reason is that a put option provides a hedge as the price of the stock goes down. This hedge may be valuable to those who have already bought shares in the company. The drop in puts when the stock rises is an effect of the increase in probability of exercise. Suppose the put is $0.50 when ABC is at $20, a drop to $19 makes it more likely it will approach or stay below the strike price at later dates. The put option holder may feel he's more likely to exercise, making the put option worth more.  These options aren't free.  When you or someone else exercises the put, the company pays for the shares of ABC that are returned or purchased on your behalf.  The company makes less profit if a high share price forces them to buy a large amount of shares, and loses more money if the stock's price does not rebound. This is sometimes the opposite of a drop in the share price."
[INST] I am the sole owner of an LLC. Does it make a difference if I file as an S-Corp or a sole-member LLC? [/INST],"As JoeTaxpayer's answer indicates, if you are the sole owner of a business there is little gain in forming a corporation in the first place to obtain the liability protection that makes sense in a more typical scenario. On the second question, the big difference between filing as an S-Corp v. a sole member LLC is how the distributions are treated. S-Corp distributions, especially for salaries to the owners, have some tricky IRS rules and guidelines to keep straight. If you choose this entity type, I'd highly recommend getting an accountant to help your with the legal and financial aspects. LLCs are simpler all around as they're more flexible and easier to understand in this regard, and also allow more flexibility. When you elect to pay taxes as an LLC (instead of a corporation), the earnings are simply divided based on the percentage of ownership (meaning that more ownership = more profit). You determine the ownership proportions based how much you've invested or however you otherwise come to an agreement. You have a little more control over your tax filing and the way the business is organized in an LLC, so the paperwork and reporting is more flexible. As such, the LLC has more flexible structures, a different default structure, and the rules regarding entity types varies a bit. So, it can definitely benefit you to select an LLC in this case, but you need to know how those structures are defined before you make your final decision. In the situation you've described in your question, which you can always structure differently if you need, the rules for an LLC are likely more beneficial. A good start would be taking a look at the differences between sole proprietorships, LLCs, and corporations to gain a little knowledge of the concepts. Also, there are specific differences and guidelines for forming an LLC in your state - so be sure to get some legal information there as well before taking that step.","The main issues would be your liability if a creditor or plaintiff got a judgment which exceeded your insurance or your own personal assets. A creditor would be looking to go after the entity, not its controlling members. To protect your personal assets you want liability protection from your corporation which would normally be accomplished via a General Corporation. You need to have it set up so that you can file the Articles of Organization to your state and get the IRS EIN so you are operating correctly. You could save the taxes and set up an S Corporations which allows some of the income to flow to a personal return where you can then offset against ordinary income. Or you could set up a C Corporation which pays its own taxes so some of the income is still tax free, but you end up getting a business income tax return as well as a personal income tax return."
[INST] How can I use hedging strategies to manage my wealth? [/INST],"Hedging is a risk management strategy used by individuals and businesses to minimize potential losses from an undesirable outcome. It is typically used in conjunction with a long position, such as a stock, to reduce the impact of price drops. Hedging can also be used to reduce the impact of currency swings or interest rate changes.

Individuals may use hedging strategies by investing in financial instruments such as futures or derivatives, which are designed to help protect the value of an investment from price fluctuations. These markets allow individuals to sell or buy contracts at a specific price and set time, such that the holder of the contract gains if the value of the underlying asset increases above the strike price, but also takes a loss if there is a decline in value.

Companies may also use hedging strategies to manage their risk. By investing in options or other derivatives, they can ensure that the value of their investment does not drop, thus reducing their future losses. Additionally, businesses might invest in commodity-related futures to manage the risk associated with commodity markets. For example, companies with heavy exposure to oil price swings can buy futures in order to protect against the downside risks associated with a drop in prices.","Hedging strategies are used by investors to offset losses by reducing or eliminating risk. Hedging strategies do not aim to increase profit, but rather to decrease losses that would be incurred through certain positions in the market. Using a hedge, an investor's portfolio will retain the same exposure and overall value, but reduce the potential short-term fluctuation. These strategies are used by individuals and organizations when in the process of investing in securities or commodities. One example of a hedging strategy is selling the securities they have, or short selling, which is the opposite of a buy order. If an investor is invested in many different commodities, they can use shorting of the commodities. There is also put and call options. If an investor buys put options, they gain in value should the underlying commodities move below the purchase price. If instead they opt for call options, they gain in value should the commodity move above.  Options in and of themselves are risky. As is the case with many strategies, there is a level of risk in the implementation of this strategy.  Other types of hedging strategies include buying and holding the securities, or buying options against those securities. These strategies are very complex, and should only be used by those who understand them thoroughly."
[INST] Is there a government-mandated resource that lists the shareholders of a public company? [/INST],"Some information, as to at least part of your question here. You can search the SEC's EDGAR system for a 13D and 13G filing (and a few others that may apply).  However, this is not a comprehensive list, only a subset. There is also an S-1, but the S1 is very rare. In addition, an S-3 can be filed, but the S-3 is a secondary offering, and often not the initial issue. (It also has other reporting requirements.) A filing statement is also often included, to indicate that such a filing was omitted before the IPO.  The key is also looking at the ""period ending.""   I've pulled this filing list from the SEC's website (which is where the SEC collects and disseminates this info about publicly traded companies). http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html If you enter your ticker symbol, it'll search for that and pull up all of the securities that that symbol represents.   If there are none returned, you may need to check your symbols, maybe something about the space bar, or the capitalization.  The ticker symbols are NOT case sensitive, and this also searches for the various ""tics"" that are often used by brokers, for example ""EZ-A"" is a ticker for Amazon.Com. http://www.sec.gov/Divisions/investorinfo/marketstructure/stockticker.pdf Other companies use a space, instead of a hyphen, though "" "" also works in a search.  14a is often used for a definitive proxy statement. A 14C is a solicitation only, and requires a 14D being filed in order to confirm a vote. (Thus there is also an 14D/A filling required as a follow up.)  These may also appear in the ""amendments"" section, if the first filing did not contain everything that was required or needed to be added for the specific action. If you click on each item, it'll bring you to a detail page about the filing.  There are separate filing systems for 8K, 10K, etc, that are not part of EDGAR (though some, like Forms 8K, 10Q, 10-K are also part of the system) However, there are more than 100 filing systems that all use the EDGAR system. This is only a small portion of items that are part of a 13D. However, this should give you enough to work with at least, and you can find the rest of the specific information you need if you wish to take this further.","Yes, there is. Many countries have public repositories that, for a nominal fee, you can look up how many shares of a company were sold on a particular day to specific buyers.

[INST] Renters Liability in Case of Liability Claims for Property Damage or Fire [/INST],"Doesn't matter what the insurance coverage is, you should always be covered.  If your landlord has insurance, then the landlord's insurance should pay out unless you specifically get into a bad situation.  If your landlord does not have insurance, then you should be compensated by the company that you have insurance through.  If you have a fire in your apartment and it spreads to the other units, you can easily sue the other tenants that caused the damage and the landlord for damages.  I am a landlord as well but i am also underinsured so hopefully none of my tenants have to pay any more than what they have contracted to pay me to rent the property. I hope this helps.","Homeowners insurance covers the homeowner for liability up to the declared limits of their policy.  You can sue your landlord for damages and collect.  However, your landlord probably only has a couple million in a liability insurance policy, just like you only have a few million dollars in personal assets.  Most liability coverage on homes is ""personal injury.""  This is an injury to a person, usually intentional.  Some examples:   The landlord doesn't really have insurance for fire, water, or casualty damage to the rental property if it is covered under the renter's policy.  However, some landlords do have a renters protection policy if the renter will be charged for damage.  This coverage is in case the renter sues because the renter thinks the landlord isn't properly maintaining the rental property, or that the landlord improperly denied a request to make repairs to the rental property.  The landlord's liability insurer will pay those legal fees, and the renters protection policy pays the renters legal fees.  These fees can be very expensive and may equal or exceed the coverage limits of the renter's liability policy. As for what a judge would do, that depends on whether your damages exceed $25,000.  If it does, then you can sue the landlord for negligence if the landlord was derelict in their duties.  They also must have the money to pay for the damages.  As such, you may want a lawyer anyway to take photos and document your claims.  At the same time file a lawsuit against the landlord."
[INST] How do you measure the value of gold? [/INST],"You can read more about it here: Measuring Gold by Investopedia Gold is a good choice of money because it is liquid, portable, durable, and it never wears out. Gold has a long history as the currency of economies and was the currency by which nations traded because it was universally accepted and easy to trade because it wasn't heavy and took a lot of space.","According to my reading, gold is treated as a commodity.  That is, the value of gold is the price that someone will pay for it now.  That is, gold is ""worth"" whatever people have agreed to exchange for it.   However, a large fraction of gold is used in non-consumption items.  Therefore, the value of an ounce of gold is not always the same number."
[INST] Can a wealthy investor invest in or make a deal with a company before it goes public / IPO? [/INST],"You don't really need to get your company's pre-IPO shares if you have it ""as private company"". You just need to look for the best deal. I mean you can invest in other companies or invest in shares of IPO companies that can have even higher values that your own company.  The market of non-listed stock is smaller. The market of non-IPO company is smaller. Also you are going to need a professional help to value your private company and for the negotiations. So if you really think your company will raise a lot of money after IPO, then I'l highly suggest you to sell it to a bigger and successful company, who can invest more on your product / service development, and get a big money in your pocket.  If you want to do so, then you'll need to find companies who can afford to buy your company, and invest a lot in it. Or you can try and make a partnership, and give them the whole control of it. But this one is not very common for startups, for the fact the owners tend to have problems to give up control. But you have to realize that your company is valuable to you precisely because someone can give you the best deal for it. Or you can get a professional help to buy into other companies. But this is very risky, a lot of people who get out of their job to invest in other companies ended up with nothing or a lot less. But it can be the case that it will increase a lot. It is the same principle. If you don't have a stock company, then you need to invest in more than one stock company as you need money to survive and to have a good rate of return. In other words, you cannot rely only on ONE stock that will give you a very high growth over 20 years to allow to retire. If you have a good stock company, and you have been given high raises, and you are not yet 50. Then it is worth it to look for the best deal.","There is no such thing as a private investment that is a copy of a future publicly traded investment.  At the same time, the fact that a company is publicly traded is not necessarily indicative of how the investment performs.  For example, Facebook was a terrible investment after it was traded publicly.  It took nearly a year to start going up, and even longer to make back the initial investment.  A private investment in Facebook, or in another company that performs the same way as Facebook, could fail altogether before it could go public. Even among publicly traded investments, two of the best ""growth"" stocks of all time (Apple and NVIDIA) barely traded for ten dollars per share when they first started trading publicly. If you were to invest in Facebook at ten times the current price, you would find its valuation in less than a week to be a terrible investment."
[INST] Can rent be added to your salary when applying for a mortgage? [/INST],"Generally, if you could have lived without the rent, you could have been saving to buy the house you now want to live in with that money.  Yes, it is possible to add it into the equation, but it shouldn't be taken as a ""for sure"" because it means there is one more factor that does not belong in the equation.  For every dollar of rent that is deducted, you should save at least a dollar.","Yes, in the general sense you can include rent as income when applying for a mortgage.  However, how this income is counted should be discussed with your mortgage broker / banker in detail.  Some types of income are not counted if they will continue into the future.  For example, if you inherit every 10 months a certain amount of money, that income may be excluded as they could dry up at any time. For rent, as long as you have a renewed or renewable tenancy, the bank will generally assume you will always continue to receive the income.  As such, the bank does not usually consider rent as non-guaranteed income.  However, if you are a paying a fixed and predetermined rent for the duration of your tenancy and the rent paid is less than your estimated mortgage payments, the income is sometimes not counted, this also applies in some circumstances when you're not paying rent to someone else (eg if you were living with your parents). In these cases, you should ensure that the rental property is in your name, as banks may not consider these rental payments as actual rental payments to you, but rather just payments to someone else. In these cases, the bank will consider your property tax, municipal property tax and repair / maintenance costs as a part of your regular housing costs and therefore reduce their estimate of the property value.  If you are not sure, your bank may require you to get an independent appraisal done before approving the mortgage at the higher ratio.  If you are unable to produce the appraisal and your monthly income is low enough to support the down payment, the bank may approve you for the higher ratio mortgage because your debt servicing expenses will be low enough.  Even if you do provide an appraisal and are approved, you might require a more flexible structure for your mortgage in order for the bank to lend to you. The more flexible structures may have higher interest rates, prepayment restrictions or other penalties.  If you do this, the bank will want to see this appraisal and have this included with the other documents you provided."
[INST] Investment for beginners in the United Kingdom [/INST],"I have done well in my 26 years of investing.  When I started I was reading one book a day and studying, learning, listening and reading more.  I have written a little on how I have done this HERE, but I will offer some simple guidelines and the reasons why it makes sense to follow them. The guidelines are as follows:  1)   Start by saving enough for a down payment on a home at least one year before you want to buy.  That means by saving about 18,000 pounds a year, you can buy a nice place with about 75,000 pounds (a 50% deposit).  This is the best loan on the market and you will save many dollars in interest by having a big down payment.  This is also going to save you 3% to 5% in closing costs or about 450 pounds for 150,000 pound mortgage. As you build equity, refinance to lower the interest rate or go to 15 year mortgage, or both.  In 7 to 10 years you will be out of the mortgage and have a paid for house.  Then you can save for a bigger house or for a second home overseas if you like. Do not do this if you want to start a family.  It is hard to take care of young children and move them to a new country.  2)  Put another 20 to 25 percent of your income aside into a 401k for retirement and get the employer match.  After that, continue to save for retirement out of this income but don't get too carried away, you have a mortgage to pay.  If you are a high earner, put more away or consider getting a 403b (some occupations have this benefit instead). It will be very hard to do this unless you are on a set budget, so write one and follow it.  Put the 401k into a balanced fund with 40% stocks, 60% bonds... the exact amount is not so relevant... a little more or less is fine.  It will make a bit of difference in your returns.  Do put the Roth IRA option in mind.  It makes excellent sense especially in the United States.  If you are a high earner, put the money into a separate savings account in another country that will earn decent interest, like say 10%, which beats what a savings account is likely to pay here.  You might even use that money for investments in another country.  The United States is no a good investment option anymore.  The dollar is only going down in value.  3)  Take and invest your tax return for the year.  Even though you have saved already it will grow faster than normal because of the 8% you are earning on the money in a savings account.  Keep this amount in cash.  Every now and then move some of the cash into a long term investment, preferably one that allows withdrawals before age 59 1/2.  4) When your emergency fund is where you want it, start investing any more income from bonuses or pay raises in stocks and mutual funds of companies you have researched and like.  Then increase the amount every year.  This can be in one company or multiple companies.  Do this at least 3 to 5 years before you want to retire.  You can put $5,000 in a stock every 6 months plus another $625 in a company that allows stock purchase plans. If you don't want to invest in stocks, then trade commodities, currencies or other options like gold or silver.  This increases the level of risk and makes returns much more difficult to come by.  Do not invest in them at the same time.  For instance if you have the cash and buy stock you can also buy currency and gold in addition because your cash will be tied up.  When you have the money back and want to put it into stock, then sell the gold or currency.  Do this at least a month before the stock transaction.  The money that you will get back on the other transactions should be just enough to buy the stock that you want.  Gold is going to go up as long as people are buying it, but it could be much higher than it is today.  The dollar is going to get lower and lower, so buy currencies of countries that are doing well, like Canada, Switzerland and Australia. The more money you have to invest, the higher the level of risk, unless you use a 401k style arrangement and then you can't touch your money until you","It's important that you take full responsibility for your own financial security.  This responsibility for your finances should extend beyond retirement investment, but let's start with some very basic advice: You should seek to reduce your debt and then build an emergency fund. Both before and after investing in your retirement.  If we can get you out of debt, then let's look at ways we could use your money to do things that you're confident with, and not simply speculate on how things may or may not pan out over 30 to 40 years.  If you can take investment advice and make your money work for you then this is the one other thing I'd encourage you to do:  Dollar cost average. Invest at regular intervals.  You may find it convenient to make a deposit to your pension each month for now, and make further regular deposits once you start receiving your paycheck."
[INST] I cosigned for a friend who is not paying the payment [/INST],"I think the best way is to ask them how much they are paying monthly and how much of it is the principal.  Offer to pay a portion of the principal as long as they commit to paying the interest.  For example if it has a $360/month payment, offer to pay the $216 in principal.  That cuts the payments in half over a few years, so they could get on some other plan or just have a more reasonable payment.  (You should also be aware of how this may change their debt to income ratio) And be ready to be very firm about a deadline.  And be ready to walk away if they will not agree to any sort of plan.  If they are willing, then do what you can afford and you should be fine.  Just make sure you don't pay for an accident that was not your fault.","You are completely uninformed.  You can be held to default on a liabilities under any or all provisions. The only reason lenders will loan is because another person cosigns and you are only considered the primary applicant. If you agree to it - so be it, you still will be subject to what ever default provisions are in the agreement.  And this is by law and not because the lender said so. You need to know the terms of the agreement you agree to and if they were put down in writing, then you need to verify that the paperwork is accurate for the transaction.   The lender will do what ever they have to to get their money back.  This can often include turning debt collectors on you and putting a lien on your personal property if you do not make the payments.  And there could be a huge amount of interest stacking up even while you are paying the loan down.  You should consider it a red flag if they do not ask for a cosigner to even open the account.   You are not completely unbiased, you do not have any facts to be unbiased.  Just because the person does not pay does not mean that you can stop paying.  You are considered the primary and are subject to the full debt.  If he continues to refuse to pay after you start paying, you are in for a world of trouble as you are the person the lender will turn to for making payments. In the event you do pay it off, your friend has not paid a penny, that is a very bad situation to be in. Lenders will only look and what you have as your income, if you cosign, they will ignore what you are worth. If you agree to cosign, in all likelihood, you friend will not pay.  You do not have the power of 2, 2 of you against 3 is usually not enough to outnumber the creditor.  I would suggest that you decline the loan and make your friend find another lender.   Be very careful of this situation, in most cases the friend never pays and the lender comes after you to recover the amount of the loan that is being paid off.  You will never get them off of your record because there was an agreement that said you would be liable for the balance if it was not paid.  This is not something that you would ever want in your record.  This can be as big a deal as a felony on your record."
[INST] Put idle savings to use while keeping them liquid [/INST],"You also have to examine who is making you money on these investments: you, somebody else, or the bank. If you have some friends to whom you would like to loan some money to, you could consider making your cash available to loan.  If your friend pays you back, you've made money.  If they don't pay you back, well, that sucks for you.  If you have a friend whom you have loaned money to before without any issues, this could be a good way to make money without running your own business.","I'll add to what others said in this area: Investing in stocks or funds should not be viewed as an expense or tax for your money; it should be viewed as a way to multiply your money. The only real ""tax"" of trading is the time it takes to do the work and pay the fees, and even then this is far less tax than the potential gains of making a good investment. In other words, when an investment pays off, you gain more value -- whether you buy a stock or fund for 10 Euros, or 10 Million, you gain if the price goes up or down. So, put your money in a savings account if you are short-term or unskilled at the stock market. Do your homework though: A small, diversified portfolio of stocks is less risky, and likely to give you better returns than a bigger portfolio of stocks/bonds. It may also increase your chances at a gain by helping you get into the habit of saving and investing. The point of investing is to gain financial advantage by building value. The real problem with trading is that it's not a sure-fire win: stocks can increase and decrease in value, and can be risky, or it can just be that you chose poorly. Trading is for folks who are comfortable with losing value -- like gamblers; it's a game and there are rules and odds. Investing in companies is for people who want to make money and don't want to take as much risk as gambling (e.g. the majority of the population). You increase your chance of success, and the value of your money, by educating yourself: This includes reading financial documents, and understanding the markets you plan on investing in."
[INST] Are prepayment penalties for mortgages normal? [/INST],"There used to be a time when you'd want to pay your mortgage off early, because it meant that you were cutting your interest costs and thus increasing your overall wealth.  A prepayment penalty prevents you from doing this, but not many people do it anymore unless they have to close on a house quickly or are offered a very attractive mortgage rate. There is at least one case in which you may consider it: if you are using your down payment to buy a less expensive home and are going to apply the proceeds from the sale of the old house as additional principal on your new mortgage. In this situation, any prepayment penalties that you incur can be seen as essentially interest on the down payment. This of course requires that the house sell for enough money to clear the down payment as well as cover the prepayment penalty.","In order to cover himself in case of loan default, a lender will usually charge a fee for prepaying the loan.  This is because prepayment could mean they don't make as much interest as they intended to.  But he is not supposed to make the fee unreasonable.  If the penalty is high, there are rules in place that the bank has to justify the penalty, usually in ways the mortgagee does not find favorable.  A bank can make their own rules on the mortgage, but they may be overruled by state or federal law regarding the interest rate or penalties they are allowed to attach. Here's a quick read from one state:  https://www.attomdata.com/news/foreclosure-news-headlines/prepayment-penalties-homeowner The prepayment penalty is different than a prepayment that you are trying to make in order to avoid bankruptcy and the foreclosure.  If you are trying to save your home to avoid bankruptcy, ask about that.  There are usually ways your home could be saved if it is owned by only one spouse, the other spouse is in debt, and you have lived in it for at least two years.  Otherwise you can avoid it by paying the original price, which includes penalties.  Be sure to read the terms of any mortgage documents that you may sign."
"[INST] After consulting HR Block, are you actually obligated to file your taxes with them, if they've found ways to save you money? [/INST]","To my experience, yes. However your mileage may vary, of course. If your bill was paid, then HR Block is obligated to handle it. In one of my experiences they took longer than they expected and my state fined me for not filing my taxes on time (the bill being payed, in this example, isn't tax filing per se but the equivalent procedure in Europe).","First, yes, you can go to a different professional for a second opinion.  You need to be careful that you have everything you need when going through a second one, though.  You don't want to have to pay for the same things twice. If the tax advisor says ""We can save you X in the form of A, B, C, and D, do you want those credits?"" you can say no and you'll still get your refund.  If you get to the point where they've done everything and they say, it's time to sign.  That point is where you need to ask, ""What exactly did you do to reduce my tax liability?"" or similar and you need to make sure you're signing for the refund you've earned and it's not just a blank check. If you say ""no, you didn't find me all the credits you could,"" the advisor can't very well say ""but the software doesn't know how to do this particular one.""  That's like them telling you you should get another 300lbs of meat from the butcher and you go back to the place and there's no meat, your choice of meat is the one they're claiming you're missing. A really good advisor can sit down with the tax software and walk you through how they get the numbers they get."
[INST] What effect would a company delisting from the LSE to move to china have on shareholders? [/INST],"There is no ""shareholder vote"" on a delisting, and the company is not obliged to offer to buy/transfer investors' shares to the new owners or to any third party. Depends on the contract, but the owners of a VC fund do have a vote that gives them some control over what happens.","There would be the cost of the delisting and re-listing in China for investors to get back the returns they wanted. Also, in some cases, the Chinese laws limit foreign investors to get back their shares. It's possible the re-listing wouldn't be 1/1 with the LSE, and there would be some loss of value. Another cost to shareholders is the potential loss in liquidity that may come with moving to the Chinese market. Also, I'm not sure there is a Chinese equivalent of a GBP or USD, so you might have some fluctuations in the currency and have a cost to have to trade from a GBP to the Chinese currency. It is also possible that having shares in an entity with a Chinese exchange would give that entity exposure to political risks in Chinese government."
[INST] Does Technical Analysis work or is it just a pointless attempt to “time the market”? [/INST],"The market is very, very inefficient. While many would argue that technical analysis may be no better than the old ""Shot in the Dark"" method of stock buying, others note that this kind of analysis is just used to filter stocks to either buy if they hit their entry price in order to reduce risk and increase overall efficiency. Many investment professionals also use it for risk management: setting stop-loss/stop-buy points to ensure that the strategy remains profitable when a stock has reached a certain percentage beyond the initial entry price/stop-sell price and vice versa. So while technical analysis is not an accurate or reliable enough method for stock investment in itself, it can be used by professionals as a compliment to other methods of investing.","I will address only this part of your question: A lot of technical stock analysts claim to be able to tell that the stock will go 'up', 'down' or 'hold' after a certain trigger has been crossed. Why is this not true? There is nothing wrong with this. The problem is how the tool is applied. If you look at the chart, you will see that certain price patterns (such as the head and shoulder) tend to produce particular behavior in the price action. This action can be used to estimate or forecast what potential returns such a action can yield - at the individual security-level. However, at the index-level (S&P500, FTSE100, CAC40) where many technical analysis traders base their trades, it can be difficult to find a single chart pattern to represent the entire market. Such a approach is inappropriate as it does not take into account all the different companies operating in the basket. Therefore, the above method can be applied - but it is inappropriate for index trading. In the end, technical analysis is a method to apply an efficient or fundamental approach to trading. It does not claim that it can accurately forecast or estimate the movements all the time. In fact, the method is less efficient as it is more dependent on other factors (traders' sentiment, technical levels' levels etc.). The efficiency relies on the trader being able to adapt and interpret the information presented to him / her and use the analysis in the most appropriate manner for the instruments they trade."
[INST] How should I record invoices in foreign currency in GNUCash? [/INST],"If you're referring to how you should set up GnuCash, it looks like you don't need to do anything new to the accounts themselves, you only need to set the foreign currency to be used in the Payment details for invoices in the Receive Payment dialog. To do this, open the invoice, right click on the invoice transaction, select Receive payment, and set the currency in the Payment details section.","It's a common issue. Every business will deal with invoices and expenses in multiple currencies. If you want to properly keep a real time and accounting of your business, you have to have the currency rate as a separate account. I'll create a fictitious example to show you what I mean : Let's say you have an American client who owes you 100€. Let's also assume that you sold your product for the €1. You would record 100€ in Asset: Client, 100€ in Liability: Invoice Receivable, then you record a journal to the Asset: Client Revenue, at an expense of 0. You record another journal to a gain account, at a profit of 1 and the liability of 10€ to the Expense: Foreign Exchange Change account, when you receive the invoice payment of €99.99. With this, as long as you have an asset account for each Client or Supplier, and a gain account for each currency, your double accounting is accurate and you can see it in real time. When there is a need for a gain or loss at the end of the year, all you need to do is to find your net profit/loss account for each currency and put your gain/loss accounts into it, or you create a journal at the end of the year that goes to the current, and creates a gain/loss account for the net gain/loss of each foreign currency. This can be daunting at the beginning, but it will save you a lot of headaches when you actually need to look at your real time financial information.  Good luck!"
[INST] Is being a landlord a good idea? Is there a lot of risk? [/INST],"From a legal side, I can say this depends on your state's laws on how much deposit is required for a given security deposit, and what can/can't be taken out of it if an issue arises later. What can you get back? The amount you can recover when you want to evict a tenant will vary from region to region, and state to state, so you might have to hire a lawyer to get past specifics at your state level. (if you're in the US for example, it really does vary, but there are a number of states that currently have 'rent-to-own' laws that are very much in your favor if you're the landlord; they basically say  that 'if it moves, it's the landlord's property and if it doesn't move, it's the tenant's property'. There are no states in the US with favorable laws to tenants to my knowledge, but in California, there are several cities that have laws that are far in Tenant's defense, but the State itself is pretty favorable to the Landlord's defense). You might also want to consider getting a separate Insurance policy, and if you don't have one, a Home Owner's policy. There is 'landlord' insurance to cover things; but you might consider the policy doesn't do so as much if you've got a property, tenant(s) and a mortgage; in case of catastrophic losses, your landlord would generally be expected to cover all costs above what the 'Home owner' or 'Renter' policy would cover as an option. If you're in an area with high insurance rates, you might consider a small separate policy that might help you with covering the mortgage. You should also check with how state and local laws affect rental property tax. In some places, you can get a number of deductions on taxes for owning rental property, while others you would be charged taxes for maintaining 'rental property'.  If you do decide to go down this route, I'd recommend that you research the details of laws where you live, find out what costs you really think you'll be getting back when you have to evict a tenant (or if you've decided to go all-out and rent this property to friends, I'd suggest an added legal agreement of some sort - make sure they pay you in full, or you'll have to turn them into debtors as friends, not that there's anything wrong with that..) Also see if your mortgage allows you to pay any portion of your mortgage against rent, or if you need to wait for rent to get paid in full before you can start paying back your mortgage (I'd also ask the lender if they can deduct the cost of mortgage insurance or PMI from that, so you can save some money there). You should also make sure that you're aware of the property inspections in your area (do I have to take photos or a video of the property, do I have to take readings of temperature and humidity etc). I'd also check for any local laws that can affect you; for example: if it's a small town, it might be illegal to rent to someone else, if you're trying to sell and rent to someone else, you'll have to wait a certain amount of time before you can rent out property, and you have to declare you're renting it out as an 'Investment property'. You'll also want to consider things like: are the tenants responsible for their own repairs? In some areas, the landlord has to maintain and/or make any repairs, and any costs must be applied to the tenant; but in other areas, you might make the tenant do their own repairs and charge them for their time and materials, provided you don't ask for more than a reasonable amount to charge them. In the US, the current standard for what can and cannot be held in a security deposit is generally covered in your state laws and Federal laws, but you'll still want to ensure you check the local codes of conduct: generally to protect tenants, many areas do not permit 'retaliatory' measures for a tenant against a landlord, so you're generally stuck with the rules unless you want to fight a tenant in court for a 'landlord evict'. In addition, if you have a tenant who refuses to pay rent, the rules may allow you to evict them, but it might require you to pay for the entire month or years of rent if the renter has already paid. The current legal system is complex; the laws of our modern system are far ahead of what the old world did. If you look back a while","I think you know the answer already.  Investing in property is risky.  If you can't handle risk, I suggest you get out now.  You could get into property without being in any sort of debt if you were to pay cash - but that means you would have to save for a while for a down payment if you were to take that route."
[INST] Should I consider my investment in a total stock market fund “diverse”? [/INST],"The ""diversification"" of any investment portfolio is always in the realm of probabilities, not certitudes. If you have a diverse portfolio that includes bonds or other investments that are not highly correlated with the stock market, you will be less risky. This is because a crisis such as the crisis that began in 2008 might not affect the investment that is not highly correlated with the stock market as adversely as it would affect the stock market. However, at the same time, if one of your non-stock investments is poorly thought out or is itself not highly diversified, it may also decline at the same time as the stock market; or if you diversify too much, you may end up not giving the stock market a chance to recover as when it is on its way up again the rest of your investments may end up going down. I think you should be investing in mutual funds instead of ETFs if you buy on a regular schedule and invest a fixed amount. The management fees of ETFs are just too high and they are more suitable to large purchases or trades where you get them at the NAV rather than through a market maker. You may also want to look into a company such as Fidelity (or maybe Charles Schwab or Vanguard) and try to balance your investments among mutual funds they have available. Don't just go for the lowest expense ratios, since you may find your choices are not very good. Instead look for mutual funds with a good record of beating the overall market without too much out-performance in bad periods. Fidelity has, for example, a number of mutual funds that might fit what you want, I find Vanguard too ""investor friendly"" so I tend to shy away from them; I find that their investments are in fact less varied and more likely to underperform the market when it goes down. The most important fact to understand what is that whatever happens, your wealth can still be more than adequate; thus, it doesn't matter if the stock market goes down but rather whether your wealth is more than what you need; how much risk you can be exposed to is limited by what you need later on, not by what your overall situation is at any point in time.","1) Investment funds must by law carry out periodic valuations of the value of their assets. They are then required to publish the results of the valuation as well as any variance between the previous valuations. 2) This can also be an element of their marketing as it is part of their sales pitch to potential investors. 3) These valuations occur independently of the manager. I.e. even if the manager is asleep they cannot stop the valuation being performed. 4) For this reason a single manager is unlikely, in and of itself, to bring a fund's assets into bankruptcy. The valuation process is designed to prevent this from happening. So, yes. You should consider your investment in a total stock market fund as diverse. It is designed specifically to be diverse and it will (in large measure) remain so."
[INST] How do wire transfers get settled? [/INST],"At the most basic level, a wire transfer is a message that you as the originator (with your bank) are going to send X amount of money to Y recipient, to be paid at a specific bank on a specific day.  The bank that received the wire then puts X amount in the account of the recipient at the bank they specified. To actually settle the wire transfer payment, funds from the sending bank will be wired to the receiving bank on the day payment is to be made. If it is an international wire transfer, then it is pretty much the same thing, but they just use the SWIFT network to do inter-reconciliation of payment instructions and processing. The SWIFT network allows for banks to get rid of the paper-based transmittal messages used in the past (which was the way we ended up with all the banks doing in-flight airplanes full of cash to pay for large amounts of money). Also, SWIFT has a lot of back-office support to make it easier for banks to pay the recipient.","A wire transfer would be similar to (but not the same as) a cashier's check. With a cashier's check the payer deposits US dollars into the bank, then the bank creates a ""check"" out of the money in the account. For the wire transfer, the bank sends something similar to ""Ach"" to the receiving banks account/account number then the receiving bank credits your account with the USD's in their foreign (i.e. not US) account."
[INST] What's the least risky investment for people in Europe? [/INST],"You can start doing this right now, right by your own house. Do you have any investments, shares, stocks, funds? Are you paying too much rent? Are you paying too much for running a car? You need to start an emergency savings, as you should not really do this in any other way and in emergency it will keep you going until you can settle your debts elsewhere. So in conclusion you can save 20%. You can find lots of financial advise on internet but before you start investing it would be nice if you could get to know something about personal finance and investing. It will help you to make a more educated choice what is the best fit for where you are now and where do you want to be in the long run. You may find it difficult to find that type of adviser. I would recommend to start checking out the following links I recommend, if you want to learn more about personal finance and investing, before you actually jump in the mud and risk your money somewhere else, until you are completely sure what are you doing and what do you really want to achieve.","There are lots of options, but this question is hard to answer.  The least risky depends on the investor. I am going to give an easy option for you first. Second will be for someone more adventurous and who can afford to lose a bit.  Option 1: Put every penny possible in an emergency fund of bank accounts.  Aim to have at least six months of emergency funds. Option 2: A bit riskier is to put money into long bond ETFs or bond equity ETFs.  For example an emerging equity and bond ETF will include bond securities plus equity in emerging markets.  You want to choose ETFs that are low cost but with long track records.  The reason for this riskier option is that most of this will go into countries that have a high probability of paying dividends and interest in the Euro currency.  In addition, the equity portion will mean that you are more invested in growing companies.  So, you are not going to have much risk here, as the interest plus company growth should pay for the cost of the dividend, even while currency moves or political events occur.  This option means you are doing more investing.  So there is more risk, but you are not going directly into a risky investment.  I would consider some of this money to buy some small caps in emerging markets, as their upside potential is greater, and you want some of this upside.  You would probably want to divide your funds so that no one country or company has too much of your money. So, you need to decide if you want to invest as is and grow 10% over 30 years or invest and invest in the best way for you.  You do not want to guess based on some advice.  You need to decide what your risk aversion is.  Once you do that you can make a decision."
[INST] When would one actually want to use a market order instead of a limit order? [/INST],"There are many reasons why a trader might not want to use a limit order or a stop loss order.  One major reason is that the stock price can often jump or gap on a surprise earnings report, or on some other news such as a lawsuit, new products, takeovers, etc.  In these cases the traders want to enter their orders early before the breakout. Even then, sometimes volume is not high enough to give any indication on whether the breakout will continue up or the bulls will run out of steam and we'll see a pullback. Some traders will place market orders near the breakout level in order to get their shares out of the stock before the price drops back to previous levels.","You usually want to use a market order for larger orders.  In a market order, you just tell the broker to execute the order immediately at the best available price (market).  So, you are in and out of the trade sooner and take greater execution risk.  If you do a lot of trade size, you would want to use a market order (because you do not want the price to move 1% away from the bid because you can't fill your order within 1 minute). On the other hand, when you place a limit order, you specify a price level that you want to buy/sell at, and the order usually does not get executed until a counter-party is willing to trade with you.  Therefore, you are more in control on the execution price."
[INST] Do you have to be mega-rich to invest in companies pre-IPO? [/INST],"No, you can buy shares in a company before an initial public offering (IPO) via a private equity fund (also known as a venture capitalist fund or VC fund). The general partners in this fund collectively make decisions about which early stage companies to invest in. If a company grows rapidly and does not need to use more equity financing (i.e. more funding via an IPO or the sale of shares to a strategic buyer), it can take 10 years or more before investors may be able to exit the deal via an investment bank or a sale to a strategic buyer. The general partner receives a fee for managing the venture capital fund, and a fraction of the profits gained by the fund. If a company does not find a company or go public, investors never see any return on their investment. Investors are typically accredited investors, or people who invest in the funds directly. Some of these investors may also be wealthy.","This is actually quite possible. I have been doing this for a few years now and I have had decent results. What the company is looking for is an investor who can help them in some way, if they believe you may be able to help them in some way or that you have a lot of contacts that can help then they should consider you an Angel Investor and it's possible for them to be willing to set up these kinds of deals for you. The one that I went through I invested via a Venture Capitol firm that had contacts within the company to setup the deal.  So basically I had to start contacting people within the company, and this took me more than a year to finally get to the CEO and the Chairman of the board and that is how that opportunity finally came around. Another form of doing this is to find yourself a broker that works with these kinds of investments. I have a broker that works with these kinds of investment that can help point you in the right direction. I think one thing to remember, and what I am doing at the moment is look for smaller companies with high turnover, these will have less risks and have a more likely chance of becoming an acquisition target soon."
[INST] Does SIPC protect securities purchased in foreign exchanges? [/INST],"Most of the banks and brokerages had insurance provided by the FDIC and SIPC. After that 3.3M people lost money. Some banks failed, some banks were sold. The FDIC and SIPC insured accounts up to the insurable amount. If an account holder had more than 110K insurable dollars in one bank or brokerage, they lost some of their money. For those who only had insurable dollars the accounts are still open.","SIPC protects cash and assets (except for stock). So while a large equity position is likely to be protected, losses on currencies and the actual investment would not be protected. If there are questions regarding the status of the currency, ask the bank."
[INST] Estimate probability distribution of profit on investment [/INST],"There is no way to predict it beforehand. The whole point of investing is to make a good return. However, since you can't tell beforehand what exactly will work, you have to consider it as random. Probabilistic thinking is much more suited to this kind of thinking.","There are three separate questions. I'll give you three separate answers. 1) What is the probability distribution of profit on investment? Without more details, I cannot answer this. 2) Why should a profit have a distribution? Any time there is an element of chance or chance-like behavior, there is a probability distribution attached. The most common distributions you will find are the normal distribution, the Poisson distribution, and the Binomial distribution. 3) Can you give an example of where profit on investment has a distribution? Let's look at the example of a company like Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) CAT currently costs $93/share and they have earnings of 3.26/share. With a share price of 93 and an earnings per share of 3.26, you can calculate the ROE to be 3.5% by: However, a company's ability to maintain that return on investments (ROE) year over year is based on many factors, not just a high and stable ROE. Thus there is a chance that next year's ROE will be smaller than this year's ROE -- say 3.4%. Or it may increase to 3.6%. Or it can be as high as 3.7% or as low as 3.3%. In my opinion there is no way to determine the probability distribution because there are just too many factors that affect next year's earnings and share price (and thus next year's ROE)."
[INST] The Canadian dividend tax credit: Why is it that someone can earn a lot in dividends but pay no/little tax? [/INST],"The Canadian tax system is progressive. This means that if you earn more income you pay more taxes. The effect on your marginal tax rate depends on how you have structured your finances. Do you have high interest expenses due to leverage, or high expenses to produce your income or large foreign source dividends. If you have all of those then your tax rate might be very low -- especially if you live in Alberta, Sasketchewan, BC or Ontario. These provinces have tax rebates for small business and dividends earned offshore. In BC dividends are completely tax exempt. Also you should remember that tax is calculated on the net income, not your gross income. So if you earn $100k in dividends and pay taxes at 11% then you are still left with $89000, and a very low marginal tax rate. So the effective tax paid on a dividend is not as high as it seems, but of course many dividend earners will have taxable income in a high tax bracket leading to more than minimal tax being paid.   If you are in a province with tax rebates then your marginal tax rate will be very low regardless of income. The effective tax rate starts below 5%, but becomes as high as 12% for someone who is not taking advantage of the tax rebates.","In the end, Canada is a socialist country: your wealth should be fairly distributed to you and everyone else. In the end is also the key part: you can go as poor or as rich as you want, but you have to pay your bills in-between.  I should stress the taxes were intended to be applied more to the wealthiest in society, but now 35% of families have the principal wage earner with incomes above $100,000.  As such, the dividend tax credit is also given to them, where in Canada, any dividends and interest are taxed less then they used to be taxed.  1971 39% 1984 29% 2000 28% 2013 25% This applies to dividends.  And taxation on all sorts of investment/income has been slowly adjusted (e.g. capital gains tax).  There also is adjustments to the tax system in general:  http://www.mytax.gov.on.ca/htdocs/10year.pdf In the end, you're just a tax-reduced version of a small-business owner.  What you do with your dividends is up to you.  And Canada taxes you more if you are a company."
[INST] FX losses on non-UK mortgage for UK property - tax deductable? [/INST],"Your options are either to sell the property and make a loss or pay capital gains tax on sale. If paying the taxes, you need to do the math yourself to see how much you would like to sell the property for and still make a profit. But first I suggest that you ask your accountant and get them to do the math for you.","I am a UK based accountant so I am giving an accountants answer. Do you want some free advice about FX risk management? Firstly I would suggest you look at this article from the FT http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/05091453-beb3-11e2-9c38-00144feab49a.html?ftcampaign=link:contentshare&pnl=n_1f423f88d8&nclick=false, regarding how you can manage your sterling risk should the EUR/GBP cross to 90p per Euro or below. This is the rate where you could buy a property in the EU for around the same price as here in UK, but in EURs. However it could be possible for you to invest in this property through a company or another entity rather than a personal investment. In some cases this could save you tax as it might be allowable as an expense to the business. It might also reduce your sterling risk, if you want to sell or your company runs up some bad debts, then you can sell or even liquidate the company.  This depends on what the companies do business do, but if they are investing in property abroad on EU/Non-EU countriies then I believe in most cases it would be possible. For what its worth I think a lot of people will have thought about buying property abroad in foreign currency, I think you should take your time to make sure you aren't getting over leveraged.  The main thing is you need to ensure you manage your sterling risk should foreign currency movements go against you."
[INST] Why is stock dilution legal? [/INST],"When you bought the shares, were you also promised to receive voting rights to the proportion of your investments in the company? If not, then what you bought was a share that is not a voting share. I personally have a hard time understanding why people want to invest in a company that doesn't allow the investors to determine a decision as important as diluting their investment. Not being able to vote on such matters just doesn't sit right.","There are a few reasons, but here's the basic framework, and you can see how any of them could be expanded upon.  First and foremost is the primary issue of stock dilution: Who will own the firm?  Generally, a board is made up of investors who are looking out for their own interests as a shareholder. It is not looking out for your best interests:  Your best interests are the interests of a director and shareholder who has the same outlook you do.  Thus, some sort of voting by stock is warranted so that the ""biggest shareholders"" can decide who the board members are.  A corporate structure is also necessary for this to be legal: There needs to be some body of law that is responsible for making this happen. Usually, that is state law, and it's called a ""general corporation act.""   In many ways, a public/publicly traded firm is the best outcome if the goal is to be a truly democratic organization where anybody's stock has a say in the business.  Many firms and some states have made that process overly complicated. So, to boil this down to a very basic example.  Let's say I set up a firm with 100 shares of stock at $10 each, and I'm sitting as the sole director as well.  If the voting mechanism is one vote=one share, then as long as I and one other person each owned 50 shares, we could get anything passed and vote ourselves out of office as directors, and still have the company continue to operate.  I own the firm with 50% of the voting power, and another individual owns the other 50% voting power, and the other folks who have 1 share don't have a say at all.  Thus, a share split or a stock dilution is important to make sure that those 50 small shareholders get some voting power on what happens to the firm.  Another complication may exist where that other person doesn't trust me and wants to be the sole director.  This may entail some form of stock dilution in either person's hand, but we will get to that later. But if all the shareholders in the world could vote on that, then it would be undeclared war against me at this point in time, and I would never be able to do business or make any decision for that matter.  The stock splits are important to keep the voting rights from going to those who do not have a say in the firm, and dilution allows for more shares to be ""sold"" so that there can be more shareholders around making up the body of voters."
[INST] How should I pay off my private student loans that have a lot of restrictions? [/INST],"Your credit score is not impacted by your student loans, only payments that are late.  There are some loan companies that will take a payoff, which includes your interest.  You can check with them to see what they will accept in exchange for clearing their loan off your debt. My student loan company does not offer any debt-restructuring programs, and that is typical of private student loans.  There is only 2 options, and if you cannot afford to pay, one option is bankruptcy. You have a degree, if you can learn how to program, then you can make far more than you ever will in the US as a teacher.","If you can't afford to repay the loans you're going to default, you're going to default. Don't waste your time worrying about whether you'll be sued or whether your bank account will be frozen. Just stop paying them. The school will sue you when the debt is big enough, and they've determined they can get some of the money back. The lender will freeze your accounts when the debt is big enough, and they've determined they can get some of the money back. The legal system is slow, and bureaucracies are slow, and even the most aggressively unresponsive debt collection agencies will eventually give up on trying to chase you. In the mean time, get your finances sorted out, and decide how you want to tackle repaying the debts. You can just pay them off in bulk or go back to the schools and set up a payment plan with them. If you're going straight to the schools, don't forget the private lenders may offer a payback plan as a concession. When I was making large monthly payments to one of the large banks, they suggested an alternative plan of smaller monthly payments that would be twice as long, interest-inclusive. If you can manage it, negotiate to pay them something, even if it's less than the minimum required monthly payment."
[INST] Why are interest rates on saving accounts so low in USA and Europe? [/INST],"Why? Because saving is not worth it, there are better things to do.  What else can you do with money? You can buy a stock, bonds or real estate to earn more. You can spend it. You can even gamble with it. This does not look well to a central bank, but they don't call all the shots. To put it another way, what you want or expect will probably happen will most likely never happen. That's the whole trick if you get the whole point of an open economy. If you can take money out and put it somewhere else, that's called an open economy. If money went in and stayed there, that's called a closed economy or an investment. If this sounds like bad advice, you don't have a lot of experience at investing in a variety of assets. If a central bank or regulatory authority has any function, it is to maximize the return of the economy. The return is defined as being the highest per capita income possible to the people of that country. That means more work can be done, more products get produced and more sales can be made to other people. This is why central banks want low interest rates, it makes the economy go faster. The trouble is that low interest rates can cause problems of their own too. Low rates, with a lot of debt or money, can make the economy go fast, but it often means overstretching the economy in the form of overspending and overproduction. The central bank doesn't have an interest in a bad market, there's no economy there. What the central bank should care about is preventing those bad situations and it's better to do that by avoiding them altogether. So the central banks set interest rates to maximize the return of the whole economy. The government may help them out with policies to control or promote this interest rate. They do this with interest rates and other forms of policy which is the same as saying with rules, regulations, bribes and other incentives to businesses, and sometimes tax changes or other tricks like giving away money.","I am going to quote from the other answer: They are paying close to zero because they can lend to you at 0%, and you will go and buy treasury bonds. Why would US taxpayers be willing to pay them? They do that in the hope that they will get higher returns. Why would tax payers take such risks? Do banks really believe that they can buy bonds, or invest in such a way that they are going to get high returns out of the funds lent by depositors? Well, no. But they need to believe this. 1. Taxpayers are willing to buy bonds because they are perceived as risk-free. Taxpayers are also willing to buy bonds because they think they are going to get back their principle. 2. When banks have funds to lend out, they want to invest that money somewhere: Either through loans, or buying bonds. The banks know that they need to be able to offer depositors good interest rates in order to be able to lure in investors in the first place. 3. They are in an ""easy"" monetary situation. The US federal reserve is currently printing money and flooding the economy with US Dollars. (The other central banks have the same policy of printing money and reducing interest rates) They believe that money printing will ultimately drive up inflation, and therefore, they want the money to be loaned out and invested, rather than kept in bank accounts. If the banks are offering zero or near-zero interest rates, depositors are forced to invest in something else with their money. As depositors are forced into the bond and security markets, the prices of these commodities have risen. This has driven down the return on investment. 4. The cost of investment. If a bank is operating in the ""squeeze"" between high returns and low interest rates, it will cost them more to pay for investments. Even in a low interest rate economy, the cost of investment is still a factor. So, a bank may choose to keep its deposits rather than risk their investment."
[INST] Comparing the present value of total payment today and partial payments over 3 months [/INST],"Well, at least one advantage of the second option is that you don't have to pay $3100 today up front to get paid 3 months from now.  There are advantages and disadvantages to making a large payment up front versus making smaller, monthly payments.  Depending on what kind of credit they gave you, and what kind they are willing to give you more of, may dictate whether or not you have any interest and/or fees added. In this case, since you can take either loan out and they have not mentioned anything about adding fees (like an origination fee), the better deal should be whichever one saves the most interest and fees. With the current payment structure, the first loan saves 7 days of interest ($8.72), which is less than the origination fee ($25). Because there is no origination fee in the second loan, it appears that it is the cheaper loan at the end, especially when you consider inflation over 3 months. Depending on your personal circumstances and how much you can afford to pay now, if the second loan gives you more favorable repayment terms now or for the future (maybe your current student loan payments come due before you have to start paying the second loan), that might also be preferable.","The present value of a payment made at a single time has a clear value, i.e.  a particular sum of money. A partial payment made at multiple times has less of a value as it will take a longer period to receive the money in full. Thus the value of the money received will be worth less at each instance it is received as there is a present value. If you have a partial payment made at a single time then you could re-arrange your finance plan to allow the single partial payment to be made at a similar time to the single total payment."
[INST] Will paying off my car early hinder my ability to build credit? [/INST],"It should not hinder you to build credit. If it is going to hurt your credit score, it would have been bad before the payment. There are people who will tell you that it would make credit look more available, however, there are many ways to accomplish this. I would imagine that it would boost your score a little from the increased credit available. If someone's view was the loan was the only way to keep payments on time, the person saying it didn't understand the payment process. For example, a car can be paid 2 different ways. The dealer can take the payment and go online, or they can go online and submit the payment after it is received. Many dealers will take a large payment each paycheck. For example, pay the $75 extra and get it off your plate, go the entire pay period, then pay the next $75. So by going in and paying the entire loan off early would have no affect on your credit as long as it was in the past. The only think I would like to point out which would help your score is get the dealer to update your report. If you can get someone to verify it was paid off early and paid in full, you can update your credit report. This would be especially important with a loan as old as yours. I believe it depends on your age and your credit score on how long it would take. If you are in your mid 20's, it could take several years. Where it would probably reflect faster on someone with lower income. You did not state what your credit score was, but I would bet it is not 1800. Also I would bet it was very low, say in the mid 600's or low 700's. With the interest rate so low, I would say pay it off. I am not going to lie it is a lot, but it is the least bad option you have. Pay it off, then shop for a card with no annual fees, get that for a few years, then when you hit 23 pay off the card. You can get a good credit score, even by 21. I know people who did this on accident. At 21 I had around 2200, and I had no interest in my credit score. I just wanted a debit card so I would know my balances. Well I accidentally signed up for a credit card, found out my rate was at 12%, then panicked and paid that card off. I pay it off every month, and just received a new card that had 0% interest. In the end, don't take my advise, take the advise of someone who actually knows what they are talking about.","So you are looking for a way to prove you will pay $450 a month for the next 36 months. How do you do that? Is paying $462.50 every month any way in which you might prove that you will pay $450/month every month? I think that you cannot prove that you will be able to pay a bill. You can show past payment history and future ability to pay using ratios of current income compared to what bills need to be paid. The other thing to note is that paying less means the loan will amortize (pay down the principal faster) on the loan, meaning you will likely qualify for credit cards when payments are made. Banks like to see on-time payment history of loans, and they like to see a small number of credit accounts being paid that are close to the maximum amount the account can borrow. Paying off a loan immediately may raise your utilization of credit and might hurt you more than help."
[INST] 1.4 million cash. What do I do? [/INST],"This is pretty broad - there are a number of answers that would be correct.  I'll just give you some information from which you can try to make a decision. The first thing to consider is how accessible your cash is.  Generally, the two choices that people go through are guaranteed and risky.  The guaranteed investment options include GICs (guaranteed investment certificate), cash funds, government bonds, treasury bills, etc.  Each comes with a different rate or rate of return.  All are designed to provide you with money when you need it and keep some of your money safe in a ""rainy day"" type scenario.  This investment is great for people who are nearing retirement or need the money in the near future.  This tends to be conservative and will return low interest rates. The riskier option involves mutual funds, stocks, or options.  These are subject to the stock market and can be highly volatile.  It could lose money over short periods of time, but hopefully will make a high return with time.  These are best used for long term investments as they can provide big returns.  The downside of these is that they could also lose you money in the short term (2-5 years).  Depending on your time horizons, you should choose the option that will provide the highest return and keep your money safe. What you have is a lot of money for one person.  You could try investing in something like stocks or options through a mutual fund, but the stock market is unpredictable and you could lose money.  You can also choose to have your money invested in GICs or cash funds while the rest of your money is invested in stocks or options. What you need to do is determine how much money you need in the short-term (2-5 years) and how much you're willing to trade to try have a greater return.  The more cash you have on hand, the more risk you take on because you're not earning interest on that cash.  If you have $50,000 in cash and invest $1,000,000, you might have the option to get a 4% return, or to get a 12% return.  However, with the 12% option, you're relying on the stock market to make a higher return over a shorter period of time. Your choice will be largely dictated by your needs, personality, and the type of investment you want to make.  The best investment would be to read the pros and cons of each investment option and pick one that suits you.  Once you have your money invested, if you need to withdraw the cash for emergencies, you can do so.  However, if you only need cash for things like short term living expenses, you can use a line of credit to borrow some cash instead of selling your shares. In the short term, you need to try to limit withdrawals from your investments.  In other words, try to leave the money invested until you need it.  You have a lot of money and don't need to cash everything now.  If your life expenses in the next few years are lower than your return on investment, you can borrow the money you need from other sources (line of credit, mortgage, etc) and leave the rest of your money invested.","I would start by setting this money aside in a savings account.  I'd open up a CD or 2 at my local bank, one of which would be tied up for 2 or 3 years (i.e.: not available for at least several years, perhaps until your 4th child is 1 year old). Do this in case there is a need for money to be used for some unexpected emergency (e.g.: your employer goes out of business). For your investment money you could set it aside in a managed ETF (exchange traded fund).  There are a lot of sites on the internet where you can get a lot of good education on this and they all share pretty much the same philosophy.  The basic approach is to invest it in low-fee funds that invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other funds (this is sometimes referred to as a life-cycle fund).  By diversifying your investments you lessen your risk when one particular investment drops (e.g.: stocks) while still sharing in any gains (e.g.: if commodities rise).  A diversified portfolio will not guarantee that you won't suffer in a bear market.  But the idea is to keep some gains over time so that you don't wind up in a worse position down the line (e.g.: just earning the rate of inflation). As far as how much you invest in various parts of the market; the conventional wisdom is to start with (about) the following: At retirement you start reducing some of these so that you won't need to pull out money from ""low return"" funds which could mean that you could run out of money later in retirement."
[INST] Value of a collateralized asset [/INST],"If I own a house worth $200,000 and have a $150,000 loan secured on it, it means I will be forced to sell the house if I default on any payments to the lender. If the house sold for enough to pay the loan, the equity would be the difference. Equity = collateral. No need to get fancy with the math equations, this is the real world, not a physics homework exercise.","The collateralized value of an asset is essentially the value of its collateral. The collateral of an asset is money given by the owner of the asset in exchange for the asset, to ensure that the owner can get it back in the case he wants it back or the asset has some negative value for the owner. For example, if you own a bond, you are expecting to get the amount you paid for the bond back by getting your payments back, but the owner's value in the bond is the collateral that you have to return this money back. So the collateral that the bond owner has for the money that they gave you is the amount that they would receive from you, if you decided to redeem the bond back to the owner, which is the par value (or face value) of the bond. So in this case, the collateralized value of a bond is the face value of the bond. Since the bond is a collateralized security, this is the main reason why you expect to get the par value and not the market value of the bond back if you decide to redeem the security back to the owner."
[INST] Will one’s education loan application be rejected if one doesn't have a payslip providing collateral? [/INST],"Assuming you live in the UK... The answer depends on how much credit you have built up with Experian, Equifax and Callcredit, and which is looking at your application.  Here is some information that hopefully may help you: In a recent report published by Experian, it was reported that over 5,000 new credit applicants were declined because they were missing one simple piece of information; such as a utility bill, payslip or income statement. A study also found:  • 43% of applicants do not bother to check the information that is held about them on the credit file. • 40% of consumers apply for products that are not suited for their needs & circumstances. • 38% of consumers submit applications on-line and are unaware of the information that the lender will require before a decision is made. The figures support the claims that many have suffered from embarrassment and embarrassing scenarios when applying for a loan.  To help you find the information you need about which is the best loan for you, here is an infographic.  It lists some of the common types of loans that are available to most borrowers, and provides a few facts about each type. To access the infographic and full report go to this link.","It makes no sense to reject your application based on that. When you apply for an education loan, you are essentially saying, ""I agree to repay back your money plus any interest accrued and service fee on the loan amount. I also accept the bank's offer for education loan as a secured loan. I acknowledge that if I repay it, I will be adding to the country's GDP and thus improving the economy thus creating more job opportunities and lowering the inflation rate for the future generation, and you would be repaying me one day by doing the same.""  (The wording may change, but you get the idea.) In fact, most education loans are unsecured loans, so unless there's something specific on the advertisement that says it's a secured loan, the bank is essentially gambling on whether or not you will pay back the loan. If indeed the advertisement says it's a secured loan, then maybe they are looking for specific documents. Check on it by calling the numbers listed in the advert. There are also some other reasons why they might check the payslip. They might want a proof about your job stability. They might want you to pay a deposit. They might want collateral for personal security. They might want to see if you have the required income. However, if it is truly an unsecured personal education loan, then the only reasonable explanation for such a rejection is that they went through an application process only to find no income tax returns and not much information about you. If this rejection is the only rejection you have, then it might just be a way for the bank to weed out people who seem unstable. Sometimes it's just better to move on and try someplace else or for a different kind of loan."
"[INST] If I were to get into a life situation where I would not be able to make regular payments, do lenders typically provide options other than default? [/INST]","The first question to ask yourself is if they are going to give you options other than default - are those options realistic?  In the end they are going to expect to get paid, and as they should.  They will not hesitate to foreclose and take your property whether that means foreclosures on your home, your car, or even your savings, investments, jewelry or anything else of value you may have.  I know of people who in the end have been forced to surrender all of their most precious material possessions to pay off credit card bills.  The fact that you find out they want their money is not the end of the world and in itself should not cause panic. The questions you want to be asking are: As you're asking credit counseling organizations how they'll address your debt, do not neglect to ask them what they, as a nonprofit organization, can do to help you that your credit card company/other institution may not be able to do.  You probably have heard the term ""work out"" a few times in your post, and indeed it is something that can definitely be a solution if the credit card company/other institution you're seeking relief from is willing to work with you - for the sake of your own financial welfare I would try them first.  If the worst happens, you can still seek their assistance even after they're unwilling to work out your debt.  You can go right to court.  It sounds like they're being cooperative with you and willing so to work out your debt with you so it's likely you can get a favorable outcome at your hearing.  It's much easier for courts to approve repayment plans that were agreed to ahead of time, especially if the only other option was bankruptcy. It is important to remember that you do not have to accept the first solution they'll give you, and it never hurts to negotiate. As for any other options they might offer, there's going to be varying degrees of what those might be, and as with any other situation which involves negotiation there is always the opportunity to try and do better so remember that you will have a bargaining chip while you have options - try to hold on to however many as you can while you're in the negotiating phase.  There are so many options that if you decide to pursue it, it can still be quite the educational experience.  However, make sure you ask your representatives (both those assisting you in credit counseling - and whatever agent or organization those creditors assign to you with the debt) for the name, rank, and email address of whomsoever will be dealing with you.  If you're not getting the results you want then you should get their full names, their emails, their phone numbers, and their supervisor's names as well as their email address and phone numbers, and keep a digital record of each contact you make.  You'll want to do all of this beforehand because sometimes it can be a bit frustrating to keep records in realtime, but if you are able to maintain them as you need to it can be a great help in a formal legal complaint. It isn't really the worst thing to default on a credit card, but you do of course want to avoid it.  Make sure you're aware of how long they want you to make payments and what they consider to be ""full payment"", make sure you're very clear about exactly when you're making the last payment, and most importantly make sure that you understand the terms of any repayment plan you may accept before signing any papers making it official.","The only thing banks do that's similar to the mortgage bailouts is charge higher rates of interest if you're late with payments, and they might charge you late fees if you're late with payments. But really, the mortgage bailouts were just a massive giveaway of cash -- the banks are really just getting taxpayer money, but being ""creative"" about it so that it's not counted as a government bailout. Basically, if you don't have the money for something you want to buy, you should probably save and make a large down payment. Otherwise, you're just going to be hounded for a large amount of money that you have no way of paying off."
[INST] How can one protect oneself from a dividend stock with decreasing price? [/INST],"If you held ABBV today, you would have still made money, but not the dividend payment + price appreciation combination. If you got in before the merger and held through the merger price drop, you would only make money based on the dividends + share price appreciation at that point. You would lose the dividends for the period after the drop till it started appreciating in price, in other words the drop in the share price will affect your long term return negatively if you still hold the stock afterwards.  This would explain why people think it is safer to invest in dividend stocks, as price movements can be mitigated by the dividends received.  You can avoid this issue by selling, but it will have tax implications if the stock is sold at a profit and may be subject to capital gain tax.  Furthermore, if the price continues to decrease and the dividend yield is decreasing, you may be in a position where it may be more financially prudent to continue holding the stock regardless.","If the stock is truly going to pay dividends, you get the dividend regardless of how much the share price drops or rises.  And dividend payments are not the same as interest on loans.  Dividends are paid out of current earnings from the business, not from retained income from previous quarters or years.  Dividends are declared by the board of directors of the company and then are paid to the owners of the stock.  That's you.  A dividend is not income generated by whatever the stock is invested in.  For example, if you invest in a stock in an internet data center company which pays out 0.80 per share in dividends every 3 months, and the price of your shares drops to near zero, you still get a quarterly check for 0.80 per share.  This is the best description of dividends I could find in 10 minutes of searching the web.  Read more here."
[INST] What is a subsidy? [/INST],"It's similar, but generally speaking a subsidy is used in a different sense than a payment is.  For example, for some programs you receive assistance but the actual provider receives the payment.  While the payor is typically the government, this isn't always so, for example: Many people will use ""payment"", ""rebate"", ""incentive"" and similar to describe a subsidy.  Since a subsidy may or may not involve an actual cash exchange, you may consider using a different term if you wish to avoid confusion.","The dictionary also defines it in similar ways to the quoted sentence. If you look up 'subidy' (in Google Books, for instance), you may find that it is particularly used in relation to government grants (e.g. for education). So, for instance, the federal Department of Education offers grants to help universities provide subsidized higher education to poorer students. In economics it is also used when it comes to the concept of market imperfections. As a result of this it is difficult to define, because the terms you may use to describe it ('market failure/imperfection' or 'suboptimal market' are good examples) are not widely used."
[INST] Are parking spaces and garage boxes a good investment? [/INST],"This isn't quite the answer you're looking for I imagine, but there may very well be an excellent investment opportunity here for many people, yet many do not understand or fully realize it.  I'll try to do my best to explain here. The value of a product, or service, is its ability to generate income.  This income can be generated either from the person directly using the assets or from a secondary market of individuals wanting to gain access to the same opportunity/asset.  This is all explained in far more depth in the investment banking side of the market, yet the concept translates well to many other aspects. For example, parking/garage spots can be used in either a primary or secondary fashion.  The primary can include driving to the job, while the other includes using the spot as storage for goods that are sold (such as lawn maintenance or landscaping).  The secondary consists of creating a new asset class of ""virtual parking spots"" that can be traded and used by a variety of different people.  For example, the ""virtual  parking spot"" may be represented by a company that is trading on the stock market.  This allows the people with the physical spot (either owned directly or through rental property) to share their income with investors who would like to own a portion of the business and receive an income stream on their investment.  This type of investment is similar to investing in a hotel, yet there are some differences.  Many hotels offer the investors a very small personal interest in the hotel, usually under 2-3%, yet this percentage is based off the entire business.  Many investments (like parking/storage) have much higher rates of return and can allow the investors to ""control"" a more significant percentage of the asset.  For many investors, having the flexibility to do so in a market that is not as volatile as the equity market is a nice option.  This income is being generated by the renter paying to use it for their storage needs.  Because of the unique demand for the asset, the rents and prices, although similar to the residential market, cannot be directly compared. In many cities and towns parking can be difficult to use for long term storage.  With the large volumes that grocery stores and other ""big box"" retailers have, the demand for storage (and parking), is generally low and unpredictable.  This is where other investors may not see many opportunities, yet if a smaller investor had this asset and created the ability to rent the spot, he may be able to provide a level of reliability and flexibility more common to those who are only concerned about the ability to park their car at night, allowing it to be used as a secondary source of parking.  Parking demand is a fickle market (although I'm sure some people may argue otherwise based upon their own personal experiences). What this means the value of parking may only be realized by its future demand.  Therefore, if you own 1,000 parking spaces in a retail center, and you are only leasing those spots for parking for businesses, you may fail to realize the true value of your asset until one of those spots is used for a new retailer and a potential anchor tenant will have better luck finding a spot to fit their needs. Your value does start to increase, yet if you have another use prepared that is able to generate revenue for you (like storage), you may have little issues in finding some individuals who do not need/want the physical spot, yet are willing to pay you for a portion of the income. I would recommend understanding the primary market fully, yet understanding how to use it as a secondary market that will create future income may lead itself to a very unique investment opportunity.  You may be able to create your own unique business/service and generate a very consistent income while many others would fail to realize its' true value.  As long as you can control your costs and overhead, you can easily generate enough income to make it worth your time, and this is where many of the other parking lots cannot because of the unpredictable nature of parking demands.","The only way it works is in the case that you're selling to a large number of people who have cars. Most condos do not have parking, and those who need parking can afford the extra cost. I've seen condos with garages that sell for twice the price, so in this case it is a good investment, but not for all of them. In your example, the condominium with 2 parking spaces and 2 bedrooms sold for the same price as the condominium with no parking but 3 bedrooms. If you ask me the 2 parking spaces are not enough for this building. Some people who are going to buy probably has more than 1 car. You should make sure that every condo has parking space. However they can save on the floor space for the garages and build more units."
[INST] why is buying trading-stock from cash not regarded as an expense? [/INST],"Because the cash is a reserve for the company, and if the company needs a certain amount for operations it would have to borrow it and pay interest on it.  If it uses the stock, it gets the money without borrowing.  And when it sells the stock later it doesn't have to pay the interest, so that's more money that it didn't have to pay.","In most accounting conventions, there's a category for investing activities. Within that category, buying (increase to) and selling (decrease to) stocks are listed as investment activity and are recorded separately. They normally come after operating activities have closed. Typically, you only look at operational cash flow if you are looking to see if the operations are paying for themselves or if the company is in financial distress. But the company may have other sources of funds besides operating cash flow, so you have to take them into account if you want to compare cash flow to total financing requirements. Here's a great example of what a cash flow report should look like for a publicly traded company -"
[INST] How exactly does dealing in stock make me money? [/INST],"When you purchase stock, you basically purchase a small portion of whatever the company does (if it's a company, that is; for shares of a fund, the shares are portions of the asset-pool).  At least in theory, when the company does well, you are entitled to some fraction of the income the company generates.  When and how often those rewards are paid by the company is determined by the company itself. (Some companies don't pay dividends at all, or in some years pay no dividends, which is why some people will focus strongly on the amount of the dividend vs. on the stock price itself.)  Some companies will use the cash-flow to pay off debt, which reduces the likelihood that the business will go bankrupt and not be able to continue operating, so the shares maintain at least some value and may continue to pay out dividends.  In general, it is hard to predict with any certainty what dividends a particular stock will pay, though you can look at the past dividends to predict what the company might do in the future. You want to purchase stock that will pay good dividends, because that is money that you can use for other things. A shareholder's main purpose for making the purchase of a particular stock, though, is to get more shares, so that when the company does better, they'll be entitled to a larger portion of the income from the company.  At some point, you may decide that it is time to liquidate some of your stock position so your bank account (or other account) will have enough liquidity to cover some future expense.  At other times, you might decide that you want to liquidate some holdings in order to purchase securities in another company that you think might do better.  This is when you might sell the stock.  If you buy a good stock, what you hope to happen is that the share price will go up.  If it does, you can then sell it for more than what you purchased it for in the first place.  (Some transactions, if it sells at a price above the purchase price, plus the transaction fee, will be a gain, thus adding to your capital gains income.)   When you buy stock, you have to consider both the potential for dividends and the potential for selling the stock for more than you purchased it for (the capital gains).  You also have to consider how much you might lose if the company goes bankrupt, or if it fails to pay out dividends, and so on.  (That is the risk that you accept.  There is risk in every investment, and your goal should be to consider the risks when you make your initial purchase.)","This is a bit of an economics textbook answer but I wanted to present a simple model of how this works, hopefully it will give you the basic idea. The price someone is willing to pay for a security depends on two factors: the demand, which is in turn determined by the cash flows or dividends from that security, and the supply, which is the amount of the security that's available and the price the buyer is willing to pay. To simplify I'm going to assume a single stock that is paying $90/year in dividends, that there's a fixed supply of 10,000 shares, and that any investor is willing to pay a maximum of $10 for each share. So now what you might say is, ""If there are 10,000 shares to be traded and that share pays $90/year in dividends, the total market cap of the company is $900,000, which means the share price of the stock should be a little under $10?"" This line of reasoning actually makes a lot of sense, but think a little further. If all of my cash earned 10% per year I would be very hesitant to tie up $10,000 in this security, which only earns $900 per year, the opportunity cost of this investment in this stock would be significant, especially considering all of the other investment opportunities available. But lets assume I value the stock at $10 each, which also makes sense. There will be another investor who values the stock at $9, so the market won't clear until the stock price reaches between $10 and $9 and there is no longer an unmatched demand and supply. The price starts at $10, and the shareholder who was willing to trade for that would be very hesitant to sell given that the company is yielding $900 in dividends per year. So the price settles around $9.50. Over time the price will drift up towards $9 as more and more investors come along.  The stock price is based on the expected future earnings of the company, and with a yield of less than 10% this stock is probably not a very safe investment. Most companies try to target dividend yields of around 7.5%, which seems to be a ""sweet spot"" for investors."
[INST] How is money actually made from the buying or selling of options? [/INST],"If you own call options, you have the right to buy, at any time before expiration, your target shares at whatever the strike price is. Thus, in that respect you can gain. If you own put options, it's the inverse: you can sell, at the strike price, whatever the contract says, your target shares (if at any time it's in the money). If you get into contract terms that mean you were given the right to buy from someone, but then that someone doesn't want to sell you the shares, you can ""compel"" the purchase by exercising the option. If on the other hand, the person you sold options you own is ""in the money"" then they would be obliged to sell you at the strike price -- you own a put option on their shares. If you sold call options, as the owner you would be obliged to allow someone to buy the shares you own from you. If they're in the money, you might wish to assign. This would effectively let you out of the transaction. If you have calls to buy the shares, but the shares are out of the money, the people you are expecting to buy the shares from no longer need you to make the sale on their behalf, so you need to either exercise your options yourself, or sell them again to someone else: this is the process of ""rolling"" your position forward. If you ""close out"" your positions in one way or another (by doing any of the above), you must then also have a way of closing your position in the other leg(s) of the contract. If the people to whom you sold an option wish to take advantage of the contract, you must also ""close out"" your own position to them, i.e. sell them shares of your own. If they're ""in the money"", you will need to compensate them to make the sale worth their while. If you did any buying, you must also ""close out"" the option as you receive the shares you were offered in the first place. If you've been assigned, you may need to sell them on to someone at the strike price or higher otherwise you'll have the shares you've acquired sapped by fees (holding the position), depreciating market value, and interest lost from missed opportunity (could have made far more profits if only you'd been able to play the market and/or hedge better). So the ""trading"" takes place in a very different way to standard share trading.","For the buyer, the actual cash amount is the current market value of the stock less the exercise price, minus the cost of buying the option; this is, money is not ""realized"" unless the option is exercised or if the option is sold. Conversely, the seller has to pay the buyer if the other party exercises the option and delivers the money back if the option is sold. A broker is involved in mediating the transactions and may charge a fee for this service."
[INST] Why do investors buy stock that had appreciated? [/INST],"You have to understand that not all shareholders are speculating. Some of us believe in the value that is generated by invested capital.   You should also understand that all owners of a given stock may not have identical price targets. I have a different price target than you do and some time before I have reached my target price I will sell and that will create a new trading range as the price settles from my high sell price to your low buy price.  If prices change rapidly, then a given stock would be sold by some owners at a higher share price than others are willing to buy for.  In order to trade, you will have to meet the higher price. Those who have a target of $500 may not sell until the price reaches 500. Those who target $750 may sell at 530 if the price continues to climb. Thus, as prices go up, there are still owners willing to sell. You may have read that if you have a stock that increases 1000% and you hold it for 10 days and then you sell it, then you were stupid because you must have sold it too early. You would be making this statement based on your own price target, not realizing that some of us have not been so eager to get off of the train that has been moving steadily toward the goal.   Many investors like to take the money and move on if they are able to reach their price targets. Others may not have reached their price targets, but in a fast moving market, they may not find the right entry price into a different stock if their goal is not being achieved. It would be like trying to sell them a 2013 Camry when they were expecting a 2016. That investor might decide to stick with the Camry for another year, but would not be so eager to sell until he reached his new target price.","If you see a stock rise over 100%, you will find a number of investors that have seen the market price reflect an asset that is worth much more than the previous price. The market believes that this trend will continue, as well as that the investment is worth something that you would be willing to pay much more for it than the market price. In sum, they have more confidence, which is what the market prices the share."
[INST] What risk of a diversified portfolio can be specifically offset by options? [/INST],"Option pricing theory says the value of an option is based on a few factors: intrinsic value (the value of the option if it is in the money), theta (time decay), gamma (the time of theta curve – steep or flat), vega (volatility), and rho (interest rates) I suppose it is possible that you could diversify your portfolio in a way that makes your portfolio more or less volatility, and therefore adjust the value of your portfolio more based on the volatility of the market.  I assume that is what you mean, but I don't know how to prove it.","Most of the risk you can offset with positions based on shorting shares, e.g. lending your shares to others or selling call contracts that give the buyer the right to buy shares from you at a set strike price. Such positions are ""delta-hedged"" by the underlying position because if the stock increases in price then the holder of the derivatives will have to buy the shares to cover the transaction, whereas if the stock decreases in price the position will be offset by the holder choosing to close (sell) the position. So the positions you take have opposite price/return (or delta) risk to the underlying position/s you hold, reducing your overall risk."
"[INST] Is it smarter to buy a small amount of an ETF every 2 or 3 months, instead of monthly? [/INST]","Why not a weekly, daily or even hourly dollar cost average? To the best of my knowledge, this is not going to help you. The way the stock market works is that if you want to earn more money, the best way most of the time is to get involved directly in stocks, and take a small loss on dividend income if possible. But, the way you do this must be done carefully, as you can get burned very fast that way (theoretically anyway, in practice, most people seem to lose their shirts pretty quickly). The best way, if you are to earn money this way, is to become an entrepreneur. The next best way is to buy shares in companies that actually pay dividends that you can reinvest. I have seen this done successfully quite recently, but my investment amount was too small as I wanted to invest $350K, but all the investment firms said no, even the 20% in tax deductions was not enough for them. So, just buy shares in companies that will pay you dividends and reinvest the dividends when they arrive to buy more shares. That is if you are comfortable paying the dividends taxes. There are also other ways that you can invest that do not require you to spend all your time monitoring your investments; however, it does require much more time than the other methods.","In order to buy any kind of ETF (even a large cap fund) you must pay  brokerage fees and incur tax liability whenever you buy or sell. I suggest considering all those costs and how you would allocate them over that 12 month time frame. As opposed to just doing it every month, you might even consider doing it once a month, but buying as large as your monthly contribution into your 401k, and using the rest of the money from one month to pay brokerage fees and taxes from purchasing the fund beforehand. As for 'Safety' this depends upon one's level of risk, in general though the answer is yes a 401k will be safer than this ETF. Of course this assumes that someone is contributing the maximum allowable into their 401k. What I would be worried about was that many individuals max out their credit limits, don't save enough money, and then make the assumption that whatever they 'contribute' into that ETF is safe money. It would always be better to max out a 401k before investing in an ETF, or you're wasting money on a tax deduction which will benefit you on April 15th only to be hit with taxes/fees/brokerage charges."
[INST] Does technical analysis work on small stock exchanges? [/INST],"I find technical analysis in general to be overvalued and misused, but I don't necessarily think this is the case for every kind of technical analysis. I do however think people should use technical analysis tools to find stocks because the tools are cheap/free, and you can try them yourself. For example, I use technical tools to quickly scan the market for some kind of trend and then start further analysis from there, just the tools themselves might not be useful for you. Here's some good things to note: What works for you might not work for someone else. You're probably not investing the exact same way as I do (hopefully). Keep track of your own work and analyze what was good, what was bad, etc.","Do you think technical analysis is a bad thing to do? Does it work on the larger stock exchanges, too? You just answered your own question. If technical analysis were not effective in one stock exchange, then why would it be effective in another? That is a question that I hope you and I can answer with something called the Efficient Market Hypothesis: The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) is a controversial theory in financial economics, that states it is impossible for investors to “beat the market” by selecting individual stocks, because stock market efficiency causes stock prices to be an accurate reflection of the information that is available to investors. -Source: Investopedia. The point of the EMH is to tell you to believe that in the short term, any information you may think you have, is already known to others. This results in the current price being a good representation of the current share value. When you say ‘buy now if technicals turn bullish’, you are saying this is not possible when the information is already taken into account. In this sense, the EMH is saying you cannot win in the short term. I believe the EMH has some flaws, and the main one is that the stock exchange as we know it (in Europe) are not actually so efficient in the short term. I've had a go at writing an answer to this and would like to say that I welcome you on board, but this is my first answer too so I hope it will be useful to you!"
[INST] Looking to buy a house in 1-2 years. Does starting a Roth IRA now make sense? [/INST],"The general rule of thumb is, if you have a 401k where you're getting an employer match, max that out.  If you don't have a 401k, contribute the max up to the Roth IRA contribution limit (currently $5500, double that if married), then put all extra money you can into retirement.  If you live off this money you won't have to work anymore when you are older. If your plan is to pay cash for a home (assuming, of course, that this is actually a wise move both financially and personally), you should put all extra money that you would have invested in your 401k into your savings account.  You've got a way more important goal, and should be working towards it.  I can tell from the 401k, Roth IRA, employer match, and home plan that you're making pretty good money (I'm assuming for the whole family), so hopefully your emergency fund will be sufficient to handle any extra expenses you have during this time.  Once you own the home, you might consider investing again by putting some money in a taxable brokerage account.  Just make sure you have a substantial emergency fund in your cash savings, since, as a homeowner, you may not have all the cash you need for a rainy day.  If you do decide to keep investing now, it sounds like your financial situation is excellent, so you could decide to invest in pretty much anything from stocks, bonds, and money markets all the way to funds that seek to take advantage of the tax benefits of mutual funds like REITs (real estate investment trusts) or MLPs (master limited partnerships).  I've included MLP's because they are similar to real estate investment trusts, but unlike REITs, MLP's pay income via dividend, which is often tax-free (as it is not considered income but more like an interest).","A couple of details that may influence your plan. Roth IRAs allow you to withdraw basis without paying the 10% early withdrawal penalty. So withdrawing $5000 in your first home would be feasible in a Roth with contributions of $388.57 each month starting today. You can withdraw Roth IRA basis after 5 years and retirement age without penalty. You can withdraw Roth IRA earnings (not basis) after age 59 1/2 but not before retirement without penalty.  I like Roth IRAs over Traditional IRAs as a primary retirement account. I also take advantage of retirement funds through my employer plan. The employer match is free money for me. If your employer has a match up to 3% or 4% and you can't set aside part or all of the max contribution ($17,500 for 2015), you may want some kind of retirement account so the employer match is maximized. I have a plan similar to the one you describe that would put $825 each month in an IRA for the next 36 months to $23,888. If that were invested in a low-expense ratio S&P index, I'd likely have about $20K in a taxable Roth and about $39K more in an IRA that could withdraw the original $20K with basis in case of some emergency. My contribution choices will be Roth IRA or Traditional 401K and I'll choose the Roth as I'm saving up for a house in the future, but I'll keep the contribution level as low as possible at my employer but high enough to keep from losing part of the match. One other point. I'm not going to recommend a specific investment. There are many options out there. Some people might consider buying a target date fund with some level of risk whereby that fund invests in bonds and stocks and can have the stocks shift more and more to bonds as you age.  If you have a 60th birthday within 10 years, you might consider this fund which starts off around 90% in stocks and ends up around 70% in stocks. Other people might choose to select mutual funds or exchange traded funds (ETFs), but I won't get specific today about those options, I'm just providing one possible choice for those that may want some level of risk in their future retirement planning."
[INST] Do large market players using HFT make it unsafe for individual investors to be in the stock market? [/INST],The point is not that HFT is bad for your investment - but that HFT can be bad as a means for making investments for retail investors. HFT provides a market where retail investors pay higher rates. These same investors receive less than the retail investor that directly trades with another retail investor - assuming that the investor has the means to do so. Of course this is only a valid assertion if you're comparing trading fees to investment performance. You may want to read up on academic studies that suggest that trading activity will lose you money over the long term - but may help you in the short term. The short answer to your question is that it depends upon whether you find it worth paying more in order to use the same broker as 'them'. The longer answer is that it depends upon whether an investor has the information to effectively trade on their own - and how they intend to use that information. It also depends on how much an institution benefits from the difference. (eg. do they make as much money from providing trading services to you as they do by trading themselves?) And this will depend upon the level of regulation.,"This question seems like it covers multiple topics: Do large market players using HFT make it unsafe for individual investors to be in the stock market? No.  In most days, they simply trade with each other, meaning they both go home with less cash than they had before the trade. Why have large companies moved into an HFT model (e.g. get the maximum cash for their stocks)? Large companies have their own reasons for why they want to sell shares now, and have their own reasons for how much they value them now.  So it does not make sense for them to try to get the public to have them pay more. Why do individual investors (and thus society in general) seem to be worse for this? Individual ""investors"" are only worse off if they pay too much for their shares.  Once the large players bought up all the shares, they can then sell them for whatever they feel the stock is worth.  If they decide not to raise the price, and offer them for sale at a lower price than what other people were paying, then that is great for individual investors.  It is just that large companies are better positioned to understand a complex and changing ""market,"" and thus have a better idea of how to price their shares compared with non-experts. It may seem counter-intuitive for large players to do this, and they may not at all, but the fact is that the ""herd"" mentality of investors that causes prices to fluctuate wildly as people try to guess how others are thinking, and thus predict future demand, which predicts future prices, is part of the chaos that can result in the stock market.  It will not make the stock market go up, because there is no such thing as an increase in wealth in the market - the wealth of the ""owner"" of the stock is merely spread across the market, and the value of their share becomes less because they have less ownership in the company.  To get the stock market to increase, you must create a reason for there to be more money chasing the same number of shares, which increases the value of ownership (which may take the form of an increase in dividends).  To get dividends to increase, you need a large corporation to do more business.  That increases the wealth of the company, which increases the money they can pay out in dividends per person that owns a share of the company. Are we living in a ""post Wall Street"" world? I don't think so.  The movie was about a fraud that happened to individual investors.  In this world, it would not happen to individuals at all. What you are talking about is just ""normal"" investors investing, and the prices they receive are not necessarily related to the actions they are taking.  There are many times that you see headlines saying that some company just announced that they did badly, so the stock price dropped by x, which is actually a little weird, because all they said was that they did badly, and you have no idea what they meant by that or if you should believe it."
[INST] What are the reasons to get more than one credit card? [/INST],"As you mentioned in your comments, there are two basic ways to play the credit card game:  Either use the credit card and pay off the balance in full every month.  If you do this, you'll benefit from all of the rewards.  Your rewards will be maximized when you use more than one card, because some cards give more rewards for spending on certain categories, while others give maximum rewards for other categories.  In that case you may want a lot of credit card to maximize those rewards, but it doesn't matter what your credit limit is, because you're paying off those balances every month.  The second option is to keep a balance.  This is the more risky choice.  If you do it right, you can earn more rewards, but you also expose yourself to the possibility of racking up some massive interest charges if you miss a payment, or if you get an unexpected charge.  It's only worth it if you know you can handle any unexpected charges, and if you know with complete certainty that you can pay the balance off every month.  How low you can go with your credit limit will depend on how high your income is, how much debt you already have, and probably a few other things too.  The general rule of thumb is to keep your credit to debt ratio below 30%, so if you have $3000 in credit and your minimum monthly payments are $10, your balance can't go above $2700 except at the end of the month.  I don't think there's any official way to apply for lower credit limits.  You can try asking, but they've probably already run the numbers and decided that you'd be under your existing limits.","Sometimes I get offered a new credit card for a different card type at zero interest. For example, I can get a Visa or MasterCard but a Discover card that offers 6 months interest free. 0% for 24 months on a Visa credit card. I have a very small emergency fund and this helps to avoid having to put a large unexpected expenditure on my mortgage. It is also easier with no interest or cash advance fees. Some cards offer better gas station discounts than I get from my other card. Sometimes it is just better for cashback than my other card."
[INST] How can I get a wholesaler ID number? [/INST],"So basically to get a wholesaler/broker ID number, you need to be a registered dealer. There are various rules and regulations that one must follow in order to register a dealer. This will require a license from a state where you want to register the business (assuming business is a dealer that also sells), a certificate of incorporation, and other documents. This is all assuming that your business will take on these requirements to register. I strongly recommend contacting any broker (which is similar to an agent to the dealer in some ways) or distributor to see how to register a dealer. If they sell to the public they might need an ID number or registration number.","You need to register with a reseller (wholesaler) to whom the vendor that sells the software will sell to. Typically, if you buy from OfficeMax, or some other retailer, they will resell to you, and not let you go to a wholesaler. And they will get their money back from the vendor, not directly from you. Hence the prices of their products will be higher. Wholesalers typically want to deal with established businesses that sell to many people, and not only one. You can find a list wholesalers / resellers on http://www.softwareid.com/."

But if anything goes down, I'm gonna complain, and I hope others will do the same.","Yes, they do. They exempt ""telecommunications services,"" as per the ""Telecommunications Package"", of which article 10 lists the ""telecommunications services"" that are excluded from VAT.  The definition includes, but is limited to: ""data transmission, data carrying services and telephony services in their entirety"".  It thus exempts all sales of digital goods.  As a result, your company is effectively paying all of those taxes in addition to income taxes, rather than VAT."

The only way that they could have both is if the ECN is only providing last prices and volumes from other exchanges - but since they're in the same location as the other exchange (presumably), you would be getting a slightly delayed version of those prices from your own market anyway.",ECN is Electronic Communication Network. An ECN may or may not have orders but they must have the ability to accept orders from the individual trader and then they pass messages about these incoming orders on to the market making firm. This is the role of the Direct Market Access.
[INST] I cosigned for a friend who is not paying the payment [/INST],"Since you are cosigning the loan you are obligated to make the payments in the event of non-payment. If they are not paying the payments, contact the bank on which the debt is held, and tell them that you are going to need to discharge the account immediately by sending a certified letter to them and your debtor, stating that you no longer wish to be a co-signor on this account. If they are still in default you may need to pursue legal avenues to stop the default, as they will keep adding on late fees you are liable for.","When a bank wants to make a loan (in this case by lending you the money to cosign a loan for a friend) they calculate two numbers: the risk number and the return number.   The risk number is the percentage of lenders who lose money on loans made on an average month.  They take a big number, like ""what if, out of this pool of borrowers, 5% of them fail to pay back?""  Then they get a number for what they call ""risk weight"".  To keep things simple here, assume any such loan will have a risk weight of .1, or 10%.   Now, once they've figured out what they expect is the risk chance of losing the money, they need to figure out whether or not they stand to make any money, and how much.  So, of course, they ask how much risk are you willing to accept?  As a borrower, you say, well, only give me the money as a loan if it will make you, say, 7 cents on the dollar, which means you'll make about $30 of $1,000 back every year.   So, in this case, a loan will happen only if you're willing to take out a loan that will lose money.  That's because, to take a smaller risk, you need to give up a bigger return. This is actually what is happening when you cosigned on that loan. Because you didn't say, no way, never, will I take a loan that loses so much money, and because banks are in the practice of giving loans, you wound up with this one.  The bank is lending your friend (the ""borrower"") money, based on the assumption that a cosigner you -- the guarantor -- will have enough income to pay the bill when the borrower doesn't.  But, since you never said anything at all about the terms under which you'd lend money, the bank gave them the best terms it could, given that they thought you were taking the risk. The point being, if you would have made even a fuss about something small, you could have gotten a cosigned loan with better terms, because the bank would have had to offer other terms.  Instead, what they said was, okay, we figured out the risk number, and we can't get a smaller risk number. Now, the question is, why didn't that friend pay up.  Maybe they didn't have the money.  Maybe they thought it was all coming from your account.  Maybe they just thought you were going to pay for the car.  Maybe they were angry with you.  Who knows? Maybe some combination of those things? But the fact that you're angry that you're paying for something that isn't yours, that's something that you could have figured out in the 5 minutes you spent filling in the boxes, which were, you said yourself, simple and easy.  Why not read them more closely?  The bank is going to keep giving loans until a borrower doesn't default.  After that happens, they'll try to find a new borrower.  So, why not look at that loan and think carefully about whether this is a good idea or a bad idea.  If you've got all the answers, you can say, sure I'll take this loan, but now I want to negotiate it so I'm getting an actual return. That was how the terms could have been better for you. But here's the rub: if anything had looked complicated or like a problem, you would have never filled out the form.  As it was, there was no apparent problem, until you were angry that you were paying.  Why weren't you angry before that it seemed like you were going to lose money?  How bad was it if you're only losing $100 a month, why so angry and demanding now? Would you have even thought about it, if you hadn't had that experience where you lost the money?   And, of course, if you really thought there was a problem, you never would have filled out that form.  So, what we have here is a problem that looks like a choice: you're in one of two places: with the bank looking in the rear view mirror, trying to see when things turned bad; or you're stuck in what looks like the present situation, and you only see the rear view mirror.  And every one is saying, but why aren't you seeing that you were tricked?  The bank knew the answer back then and it was going to lose money anyway, but you only see it now."

[INST] Can I register for VAT to claim back VAT without selling VAT applicable goods? (UK) [/INST],"A person is in business if they have one of these: VAT registration is very easy, you need to fill out this form and submit it to your local tax office. If you go to the VAT website you will find more information. In the end you might not benefit at all, in some cases it would even cost you unless you can claim the VAT on something else. You should compare the costs of your time with the costs you would save by registering. I would also suggest that you only register if there is a chance that in the next two years your business will come under the threshold for at least six months. After two years you will not be relieved automatically when your turnover goes under the threshold (and might even incur penalties). Only registering for the purpose of claiming back VAT as described in your post is not allowed under the law. That's why you need to justify the registration as being for your business. You will have to pay VAT on your sales, and then fill out a VAT claim form on a quarterly basis, which can be quite a chore, so you should factor in the increased administrative burden. You can register for VAT with only one supplier. After two years you can even deregister again automatically if your turnover goes under the threshold.","I do this on a regular basis. I use VAT MOSS service which allows you to register for VAT for a single transaction. So for what it's worth if you can demonstrate that you have goods for sale and that you plan to sell more than you have purchased, HMRC really doesn't care. As long as you are VAT registered you can reclaim via VAT MOSS."
[INST] What is good growth? [/INST],"""Good"" growth for an economy depends on a whole host of factors related to the specific culture of the populace, how much government intervention occurs, and a number of other factors related to how ""free"" the economy is. An economy that is highly regulated, but produces high levels of growth among those firms willing to operate at high costs due to the compliance would be considered a ""good growing"" economy in some circles, for certain populations. ""Good"" growth does not mean the same thing to every person; it can mean different things to different groups. And thus different groups measure it with a different scale.","For most people, it is probably better to start off with growth type funds that invest in stock. Those funds tend to offer lower costs and good performance. But if you want to stick with a bond fund, look for a no-load bond fund that invests in higher quality (lower risk/higher grade) corporate bonds."
[INST] Do I make money in the stock market from other people losing money? [/INST],"If you buy an apple at $1 a day from me, then we swap the apple for 10 apples at 10 cents each and the other guy takes the one apple, then the value of the apple the other guy gets is worth 10 cents as against the $1 value to me.  No one is making or losing money. What value has been added?  Just the convenience of the value exchange.    It's the same deal with stocks, and every share bought.   The buyer pays and the seller gains.  Every transaction is a buy and sell and every trade is made by two people, but the value that is gained or lost is a different question.","Yes, you make money in the stock market from other people losing money. This makes a lot of people uncomfortable. If you were the only person investing in the market, you'd get a steady stream of dividends, and you'd be making money without anyone losing anything. If there were only two or three people buying and selling stocks, everyone could be making money that way. In today's investment world, where huge multinational funds manage the portfolios of millions of investors, the only way to profit is if one person's loss is offset by another person's gain. Unfortunately, that generally means two or more people lose money, while your gains come at someone else's expense. Why the stock market works this way is complex, and is the topic of an entire textbook's worth of reading. There's many factors that go into stock price, including supply and demand, market capitalization, earnings per share, and investor sentiment. Some of these can be known by investors, some of these cannot. It's a combination of some predictable factors and some random behavior that determines whether the next person you sell your stock gets more money or less money than you're getting today. In short, it's impossible to remove someone's ""loss"" from the system without the whole machine grinding to a halt. It's even possible that a single investment could make you money today, but your shares get sold off at a lower price if you sell later, making you lose money. This is called the ""paradox of thrift""."
[INST] Paying Off Principal of Home vs. Investing In Mutual Fund [/INST],"If you are in a position where you can invest instead of paying down debt I think you should look into your total expenses and cut them to the bone. I don't know your expenses, but I would probably get rid of all non-recurring expenses, like going out with friends, unless there was absolutely no way to cut out completely. If you are doing everything possible to cut expenses I would get rid of the debt. In my opinion, there is no comparison. Your debt is going to be there for a while, but you will be earning investment income from the moment you begin the process. Once you are debt free, you can invest all you want. Forget the mortgage, you should pay that off as soon as possible, with what you can afford to put back, invest. Your biggest enemy is the amount of money invested, the earlier the better.","Given the current rates: Paying 1 percent on your mortgage and earning 5 percent in the market will get you an additional 5 percent. Is it worth doing? I'd probably rather risk 1 percent of the principal to earn 5 percent of a gain on a larger investment, but that sounds like more risk than I'd want to take. I'll run various scenarios in Google docs to see if there is a formula for this calculation when mortgage rates and market returns aren't constant.

If you keep spending this money, it doesn't really matter, but you need to decide whether to use it to pay down the mortgage principal, pay it down to some other threshold, or put it on something else. (Personal finance says to invest it elsewhere, but no law says that you can't save for a down payment on a vacation house if you really think you can make money on your mortgage.) As you can see in the post that I linked to, I'm in general for throwing money ""above the line"" at your mortgage, and I'm glad that your mortgage rates are low. I have no idea about your goals for how much time you spend on this project in particular. If I were in your shoes, I'd keep $1000 on the side in cash. This gives you money to cover your credit cards while you wait for them to be charged at the end of the billing cycle. If you want to buy something on your card while it is at a low balance, and wait until the due date for it to come off, you might find your card maxed out and not be able to buy something else. You should also know when your card is paid off and what your balance on it is before spending anything. If you plan to spend more than $3500 on the card in August, you should make your payment today."
[INST] What are the common income tax deductions used by “rich” salaried households? [/INST],"I'm a 12% earner and we take the child care deduction.  Its about $3,000 for the child care you buy above $4,000 in income for your modified income.  We took it on 2006, but after you do it you can't take the credit the next year. As a 28% earner you could take it for the next decade for your children. Wealthy people?  Sure, if you mean people that buy the most toys. We own several homes in California. As you know California has no deductions for home owners. So we put in almost $80,000 in a trust to pay for college educations. We took the deductions on mortgage interest, closing costs and escrow for home maintenance.  If I was wealthy I would take the medical deductions so that I can reduce Medicare taxes. Wealthy people also have tax shelters that they buy and sell with no sales taxes. That's another way to decrease your income and increase your wealth.","It is always possible to reduce your tax burden by taking deductions that you are entitled to. In the U.S., you aren't considered ""rich"" until you're making $343,000 in 2015. That's more than 99.5% of all households make. In the next level up, making $635,000 gives you a tax rate between 28% - 39.6%. At the tippy top, a married couple won't pay a federal income tax on an income of $354,400 or less.

If you and your spouse are not filing jointly for whatever reason, you each get half as many deductions as filing jointly.  Even employees who only earned a very small amount of money are entitled to exemptions and deductions, which makes up a large portion of the income tax benefits of some low-income individuals. One of the biggest deductions you can take is the standard deduction. This deduction is meant to benefit those who don't have a lot of expenses each year (usually not worth filing a return to get a refund) or don't want to go through the hassle of keeping track of these expenses. They take a standard deduction based on their age, income, and marital status. In the 2015 tax year, a married couple claiming the standard deduction has a deduction of $12,600. Deductions are subtracted from your Adjusted Gross Income to determine how much actual tax you owe. (Also note that income tax rates are graduated, which means that higher tax brackets will pay taxes on income in the lower brackets at that rate and income in the higher bracket at the higher tax rate) Deductions reduce the amount of income you can be taxed against, thereby reducing the amount of income tax you owe.

"[INST] In a competitive market, why is movie theater popcorn expensive? [/INST]","I don't know why. What I really wanted to post was that there is no competitive movie theater market. In most large communities there might be two or three movie theaters. The only true competitors are movies on demand and streaming services like Netflix. In the past there was a good amount of anti-competition measures put in place by the movie studio/theater combines. Such as rules on showing independent films or documentaries, or the rules on showing movies before their run in the theaters. While those practices have been banned or disbanded, the movie theater industry has not become competetive. I suggest that you read more on your favorite search engine about the anti-competition practices of the major movie theater chains. This is one example and there are many more. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_booking The article gives a good overview of how the big movie houses got their power, and why they stay that way. If you search for ""anti-trust movie theater"" you'll find many more articles.","They get a free show when you buy the popcorn.

[INST] Good book-keeping software? [/INST],"Have a look at GNUCash. It's open source and has been designed with small businesses and home finances in mind. http://www.gnucash.org. In addition to maintaining your own accounts, this excellent free software tool is also recommended by experts such as Philip Brew, author of the book Financial Markets: A Practitioner's Guide.  He has several books available through the MIT Press which are also a great investment.  He's also written several papers available online through MIT. Financial Markets: A Practitioner's Guide","No. For my business I'm using GnuCash.  It runs on most flavours of Linux, OS X, Windows and has many plugins in various repos for localization and integration with other software that I use. (Its in German, but most of the menus etc are self-explanatory and Google+ will be of great help in case not ...)  GnuCash supports tracking bank accounts, stocks, invoicing, receipts, and you can export to Excel/PDF in case you're bound to produce a balance sheet or other reports that require another format. It will help you to avoid entering transactions wrong and even offer to automatically export them as paypal payment invoices.  It was created by the Free Software Foundation (but is not part of FSF's software portfolio).  I've been using it since 2009 or so now and never came across a problem where the software didn't perform as expected. (And I haven't paid a cent for it!)  I've used other accounting/finance software in the past, like Execupagorika and other similar stuff but never found something that came as close to GnuCash in terms of feature- and price-performance.  On my Linux machine it's also available directly as a menu item in KDE and Gnome, so I don't have to dig for the binary in one hidden folder or install it via Gnome Software. It's available in the repos of most distributions I know.  As I said, the software runs on most platforms and if not it's available as source.  Another feature I'd like to mention is that you can easily download the transactions directly from your online bank and have GnuCash do the splitting for you, and even download the statement in case you need to store it securely somewhere while keeping the bank statements for as long as needed :-)  I hope I've given you an answer that is somewhat helpful if not exactly what you were looking for ;-) In regards to invoices, GnuCash is fully capable of creating invoices with the correct format in case you don't use a payment processor that already does this (or want to maintain control over the formatting of your invoices). It can even export all this as a PDF, which is convenient, if the customer or paypal wants proof of invoice.  If you're interested in what my business is about, I wrote a little more about what I do in case you want to get a better understanding why the invoices for my business' invoices are the way they are. I'm not trying to convince you into using GnuCash over another software: I've been using it so long that I'd have to learn a new software from scratch and most other software (that I have looked at and that was recommended to me) doesn't offer the same functionality in terms of invoicing, so I'd still have to find a plugin that has as much functionality as GnuCash. I don't like to be restricted in terms of what kinds of payment methods I can accept, so I'm looking for a solution that is more flexible than a single book-keeping app.  And I really would prefer something that doesn't cost 150 EUR annually :-)  Hope this helps.

[INST] My Co-Signer is the Primary Account Holder for my Car Loan - Does this affect my credit? [/INST],"If you're worried about your credit, don't be. You are the primary purchaser, as long as you make payments on time and manage the payments on your shared account effectively in your co-signer's eyes, your credit will be protected. Your primary concern regarding your co-signer should be how to repay your debt without burdening him. There are a couple of options to consider if your co-sigs doesn't offer to assume ownership of your car by simply refinancing it under his credit in your name. You can use the equity in your car (which is likely significant at this stage) to pay off the car loan and begin payment on a new one under his loan. However, I am very pessimistic about your chances of being approved for a loan for another car while you are already making payments on this loan, especially if your down payment on this current car was zero. The remaining option would be to sell your car through Carmax, Carvana, or another local dealership. If your car is older than 5 years, you will probably be getting more for it by selling it yourself, but you may be required to make a down payment on the next car and that may disqualify you.","Yes.

[INST] Is it possible to transfer stock I already own into my Roth IRA without having to sell the stock? [/INST],"The best way for existing shares to be transferred INTO your IRA account is if your investment advisor sells the shares and then buys the shares in the IRA with no tax consequences. (The broker sells it for your IRA from within your IRA, so it's not taxed.) That being said, it's unlikely that your IRA provider would allow you to buy shares in a stock in your IRA if the IRA was originally invested in bonds (i.e. not shares in a publicly traded company). Why wouldn't they allow it? They're being safe, so you don't buy shares that they can't sell. (Yes, the S&P/Dow/Nasdaq is very liquid, but they want to make sure, because money managers tend to go in and out all the time.) In general, many people try and find a way to transfer into a Vanguard or Schwab IRA that have the ability to invest in a wide variety of funds.","You can't roll the stock into the Roth IRA directly, but you could sell the stocks and keep the cash in a savings account at an online brokerage until you have the exact amount of cash you need to complete the rollover transaction. Your brokerage will charge you to have the stock in their possession, so the sooner you get everything into the cash account the better. In the future you could avoid this hassle by making lump sum deposits into the account instead of smaller recurring deposits, or you could make the deposits by check into the IRA account. Some of the online brokerages let you wire funds free, so this might let you do a one time transfer. If you're in a bind ask customer support, most will work with you to make the transfer easier."
[INST] Do common stocks and preferred stocks have any differences in terms of percentage of the company per unit they represent? [/INST],"Equity represents ownership of a company, whether common or preferred. The different shares are the different ownership levels. The price of the shares is the price.  Shares are not ""percentages"" of the company per se. They represent the percentage of ownership (a price is the price) at the share price at market close.  A share represents the ownership of an asset, an asset which has value. There is a value to the rights of an owner of that asset. That value may or may not be the money paid for the share, it depends on the earnings of the asset in question, and the ownership structure.  Different assets have different rights of ownership. A shares has no rights to get special dividends, it may be a non- voting share. A preferred share does not have dividend rights, it only has voting rights. A Series A, B, C shares does not have dividend rights. There are also different type of shares in terms of voting rights (non-voting, limited, full). There is much more than just price. Shares also have different levels, class A, class B, etc. When you read a prospectus, you'll start to see that it becomes more of a jumble of ownership levels.  As to ownership, you can be owned by someone else with all of the voting rights, but no dividend rights. A preferred share might have a cumulative dividend, or a dividend that is given based on the earnings of the company that are allocated to dividend payments. There are many different types of shares out there, each one giving the owners different rights of ownership. I would suggest that you read the prospectus of your current shares. It should tell you what rights you have with each share. As to the percentage of a company that you own, you own all the rights associated to your level ownership. The ownership percentage you have (let's say 1% of the company based on the total shares), gives you the rights that are the rights of a percentage owner.  I'm not going to explain different types of stocks here, there are many out there. One person's dividend is another's right to receive preferred shares.","Yes, they do!  Generally preferred stocks will pay out regular dividends at a fixed rate whereas common stocks can pay dividends when and if the boards wishes to do so. On the downside, however, preferred stock generally has no rights to any dividends that might be declared above their fixed rate.  On the other hand, common stock has voting rights and the possibility to receive dividends above that dividend rate, but a company is not required to pay dividends at all. On the upside, however, a company is not required to pay a dividend at all.  Thus, a company's decision to pay a dividend is not set in stone, it can be changed at any time."
[INST] Short Selling Specific to India [/INST],"Does the option exist to short sell an Indian company? The answer to this question is YES. For example, any one can short sell a stock in the NIFTY ETF by buying an inverse NIFTY ETF from the NSE in the equity market.","For the sake of others wondering about short selling, some information to consider: It may not be as simple as it sounds. You need to pay the price to borrow the stock from your broker, which means you need to make sure that there is a share available in a brokerage account of which you are aware. If you don't then you have a good chance of getting your account frozen by your broker. If you were to call a 25% yield short you wanted, you would still need to factor in the cost of the interest that you are due for borrowing so take a look at the annualized rate to find out the difference. Take into account the risk free rate (government bonds) + a fair return on the capital (5yrs - 10% - risk that you lose money over that period). There are a number of other factors to consider but it is difficult to factor them without knowing all the facts. The other option is to take on a contract known as a contract for difference (CFD), again this is usually considered to be risky so would not be suitable for anyone.  There are CFDs designed specifically for share and commodities indexes."
[INST] 2 401k's and a SEP-IRA [/INST],"Do not get a separate SEP plan. The current contribution limits for a SEP Plan are $260,000. Since you are an employee also, then you cannot contribute to your own company plan. This is referred to within the industry as self-dealing. So if you set up a SEP plan you would have to not participate in it. And the business would have to pay the fees, with $200,000 of tax deduction. This amount will be a minimum annual amount. So the cost of a $200,000 deduction is the costs to set up, administer and maintain the plan for the next 60 years the way it is designed now with this contribution formula. Also there may be a cost related to keeping the employer group health insurance policy. Another option we can investigate is a solo 401K. There are new regulations that allow self-employed businesses or businesses with under 100 employees (full-time equivalent) to use an old employer-style retirement plan design called the Solo 401K. This is a good idea if your company is too small or too young to use a more sophisticated retirement solution, but it is now offered by a growing number of plan providers as a way to reduce costs and fees so your plan assets get the opportunity to compound at rate of return of the asset classes the retirement savings are invested in. The contribution limit is much lower though: $18,500 or 25% of earnings annually. The benefit of the plan is that this is still enough to save money on a pre-tax basis, and if the employee also needs to add money to the plan he can make additional “net after tax dollars” and enjoy a growth tax free and come into retirement with more diversified assets. The benefit of the plan is that the cost is low, and the investment options are many.","There's nothing illegal about having multiple retirement accounts. In fact, the IRS has specifically said that you can have as many IRAs as you want, even if you're already participating in a company sponsored plan. It's also perfectly legal to put money towards a Roth IRA instead of a Traditional IRA. Both accounts grow in a tax-deferred manner though they use different tax treatments in retirement. What you're describing is pretty much the ideal situation for someone who wants to max out their retirement investments. You should check with your HR department to confirm that your company offers a company match, how much, and whether it applies if you contribute to a Traditional 401K instead of a Roth, but I'm going a safe bet that most companies do match 401(k)'s and your money will be safe if your funds drop in the event of the crash. Just be sure to contribute enough to get the max match. Roth IRA's 401(k)'s. If you can get both, go for it. Especially if you go into a higher tax bracket than you are currently in due to inflation. Note that contribution limits for a 401(k) are $18,000/yr or 100% of compensation, whichever is less, while the maximum annual contribution for an IRA is $5,500. So, if you maxed out your 401(k) with company matching you could still contribute the max amount to your IRA, but could not contribute more. If you open an IRA with a brokerage firm you may still be able to move some of your other assets into your IRA without it being counted as an annual contribution, which I recommend. This is called a ""Roth Conversion."" More info at the link: http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=96610,00.html"
[INST] Should I wait a few days to sell ESPP Stock? [/INST],"There is NO waiting period after you sell an ESPP stock.  The company decides whether it's going to buy it back or sell it to an investor on the open market.  There's no waiting period, at least there wasn't in my case. I had 10 shares that I sold and the following week it was sold, just as it was after the 4-day cooling period.  Just watch your email for the confirmation.","There are some pretty significant factors you need to take into account. The first is that if you were granted shares at $44 in 2013, then you are actually selling them for $1.37 over the market price as of June 1, 2015. That market-price could actually be higher in the future. I wouldn't recommend waiting too long and trying to sell them at a price higher than $68. As for the ""early sale,"" that is a matter of opinion. The 5% stock matching is free money, and, in my humble opinion, you should keep it. But, the stock you are selling is also free money (unless you invested elsewhere and now the market value is higher than $44). My advice: Take the 5% matching, reinvest at least half the stock sales back into the ESPP (in 2017), and invest the rest in something else that offers growth potential."
[INST] Why does gold have value? [/INST],"Gold is valuable because it has been traditionally considered valuable, because in general it takes more work and expense to acquire, and because there's a history of people wanting gold and being willing to provide labor for it.  This question is similar to asking the same about money, or for that matter, anything with value, other than asking what's valuable in general, which is a highly subjective topic. If you live where gold is more available then someone else on the other side of the globe, why would you want them to have your gold?  They could easily take it and run in such a setting.  If you make your gold more available, then either people have to take it when they shouldn't, or they have none left to trade you back for your goods.  How would you have a way to track who is supposed to have what gold in the exchange?  That alone is complex enough that one piece of gold is ""standard"" for simplicity; exchanging a fraction of something that is more difficult to divide will add complication. These difficulties and inconveniences are enough to make this impractical so to speak for most of the world.  If your business is one in which your product is not useful in any way, but rather your product is only important for how people regard it due to its rarity, its difficult availability, its usefulness in trading, or because of its perceived qualities, then you can charge more for it.   The first place that gold was commonly mined was with a high cost and difficulty in extraction, this set the stage for how it was considered valuable.  In addition, if you know you could only get a little in a certain place, and you still wanted it, you might be willing to exchange a great deal of labor, a lot of work, a great deal of your value for it.  Thus you established the basis for that value.","All precious materials, such as gold and jewels, have been considered valuable for centuries and centuries. It's not a new thing, they have always been valuable. The main reason for that is as you said, they are rare. Now, it's really difficult to say whether or not they really are, but they are scarce at least. Rare or not, scarce is true. In ancient times gold was used as currency, and some people still see that as it's main significance. However, it can also be traded against valuable services. That is, if you can't trade it for gold, you can get the person to trade you goods or services, which can be exchanged for other things. A person with gold can be seen as a wealthy individual. In such ways gold has always been valuable. This page at Wikipedia may be of interest to you. It's written in an accurate manner, and has many references about this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_valuation"
[INST] Investing $50k + Real Estate [/INST],"The $50,000 can be a downpayment on an investment property. With that much money, you could get about $200-$300k house.  If you can find one that gives you an 8% ROI, your investment payoff would be about 8 years.  That could be good or bad depending on whether you are comfortable with an 8 year payoff.","If you have an asset you plan to sell for $900K, you have an advantage in knowing your downpayment and what debt ratio you will be required to maintain. I'd suggest you work the calculations to answer your first bullet point, assuming it would take 20 years to pay back a $50K investment. That answer will then give you a range of investments to consider (depending on your desired returns).  The $1.4M includes $1M mortgage, as your monthly payment on a 5x (x>1) debt ratio is 2.06%. Assuming a 20% down payment, you are borrowing 75.85% or 75.95% of $1.4M ($1,063,631) @ a 3.7% mortgage rate you would have a monthly payment of $3,814. The mortgage rate of 3.7% is the current market rate which would be lower than a 30 or 15 year, a 10 year or a 5 year mortgage.  As an example, a 15 year at 2.5% would have a monthly payment of $3,786 and a 10 year at 2.85% would have a monthly payment of $4,026.  $50K invested at 4, 7, or 10% would all show monthly amounts greater than your mortgage payment or what you have listed in your post. Investing that extra $7K/month would lead to greater than 1M over 20 years with a 7% return. You need better clarification in your post, what your goal is, your monthly spending, and whether you mean that $60K is in savings and CDs, or whether $20K is savings and CDs.  I would suggest you look at 4 -6 different combinations of retirement and investment options and then answer the questions you have now asked for each. (You can't put $1M in a savings account and get $4 or even $3K in monthly interest.) 4% is too low for retirement. Even someone who saves 20%+ of their income, spends 1/3rd of that income and only withdraws what they need after the tax implications (they live on the dividends from the 2/3rds and the 1/3rd that remains at the end of the year), will only get $36K/yr + taxes. You'd have to invest the $1M at 5.88% to get $20K/yr, but your actual return on that $1M would be in the 30's after taxes (you'd have $1.6M in 30 years). If you wanted $6K/month you would need to generate $800K and would need a rate of return higher than 6.4% to get that. So, for a young couple, you have 2 decades of working (and hopefully getting raises) and then potentially 4 decades before you would be able to retire. You could also wait and buy the $385K house. Once you pay off your cars you only need to come up with $850/month for your current monthly expenses, 2x what you make. Your housing and car expenses will be $1,450/month, so you'd have to generate $25K/yr + taxes, which is only 6 and a half years worth of annual raises."
[INST] Double-entry accounting: how to keep track of mortgage installments as expenses? [/INST],"The following method is a simplification of some accounting principles, but it provides a good basis for your understanding of accounting and how it is related to your finances.   Accounting is the practice or method of keeping financial records to help make decisions.  An example might be recording expenses and profits to help decide the optimal amount of dividends to provide to shareholders.  It also can help you decide if you can afford to buy new equipment or open new locations. Accounting keeps track of your balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. I will give a brief explanation of each:  The balance sheet provides a snapshot of what you own versus what you owe.  The income statement looks at what you paid, what you earned (or lost), and any capital expenditures (e.g. plant and equipment) you purchased during a set time period.  The statement of cash flows indicates how much capital you spent during a time period, and provides a link between your balance sheet, income statement, and external factors impacting your business. You pay your $880 on February 10, 2018. On February 12, 2018, the monthly statement from your bank shows you have paid the $880 and you can see the balance of your ""mortgage"" account in your savings account has reduced to $2019.75. You could show this on your balance sheet at the end of February under long-term debt (i.e. liabilities) and you would have one entry under assets for cash on deposit.  These could be shown as Bank Accounts under Assets and Mortgage under Liabilities on your balance sheet.  As you would have entered the receipt for $2908 that you received when you started saving for the mortgage, and subtracting the $880 and $2019.75, you could see whether you have a net profit or loss on the mortgage. The cash flow statement would simply show the cash you put in to making the investment (purchasing the house).  Your income statement might show your monthly payment to your mortgage ($880) as your expenses and the interest you've paid as an expense, which would help you identify how much interest you've paid over the time for which you owned the house.  When you make a deposit into the mortgage, it does not impact your income statement (as you've got no income after paying your expenses).  It would only appear in your cash flow statement.","I am going with C. You have two different accounts that you are trying to combine, one is a liability and the other is a non-operating expense but is really a special sub-category of your non-operating income.  If in your mind you think of your liability account as the ""operating liability"" for your house then it helps to create a ""investments"" account.  You should create a ""house downpayment"" account, and sub-accounts under both ""housing"" and ""downpayment."" As payments go both accounts should decrease while the ""check"" account should increase.  So as to not confuse matters, do not make the downpayment an asset (like you cannot pay it and therefore it is not money you can spend now) instead let it remain a liability since you have nothing tangible yet.  You may be creating the same assets/liabilities and that is fine.  Just understand what they are representing.   I do not like your suggestion of not using the downpayment account as your operating account.   It's important to keep them separate for the reasons I will describe in #2. If you make a mortgage payment against next months mortgage (therefore the mortgage goes down) you also want the downpayment to be reflected in such a way that the account shows $0 and you know you have $x to apply against the mortgage. That's the whole accounting purpose of the double-entry (to see the net effect of all your transactions.) If you need help with an online program or spreadsheet for keeping track of your downpayment I think it would be easier to create the downpayment as it is described above, and track it in Excel. If the software package has the ability to make custom accounts then I would suggest tracking it as something like ""Downpayment to be applied against mortgage balance""  If I get time I may update a spreadsheet on how to manage this. I hope this helps a bit."
[INST] Option Trading / Demo Account [/INST],"I am writing a detailed answer here 1) Your question has nothing to do with stock market and options trading is much different than stock market trading. An option is basically a contract that gives one side an option to either buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price during a specified time frame. It is a lot like a future contract, the only difference being that the buyer has the option as to whether to exercise it or not. So, you should be clear about option trading vs stock market trading. 2) In an option trading, you either use it for hedging/risk reduction or for speculative purpose. Risk reduction with options is similar to buying insurance or paying premiums to reduce risk. There are options available in stock markets too where the buyer pays a premium to the option seller, typically the brokerage, thereby reducing risk during a time period. To fully understand the options contracts and its usages, I would suggest you to take up a course or understand its usage in context of individual securities. It is of course one of the financial derivatives and its trading is lot different than basic trading in securities. The difference in this case lies with the various contracts in terms of the strike price or expiry date and its usages (i.e. buy or sell or hedging or speculation), so please do your due-diligence. In case of the option trading, the buyer is typically known as the 'holder' or 'payer' and the seller is typically known as the 'writer' or 'seller'. The option contracts basically provide one side with a chance to either reduce risk (hedging) or to bet on future prices on a given underlying security. Please don't assume that a buyer is always the hedger (one who reduces risk) because that is not true in case of option trading. To simplify things let's consider the American type options. So there are three scenarios where one of us is the buyer and another one is the seller. The 'POTENTIAL WIN' case: In this case, if the holder of an option or call with a higher strike price than the prevailing market price exercises the option, the holder will make a profit in terms of the difference between the prevailing market price at settlement (typically in the money) and the exercise price. The seller of the option will suffer a loss in the form of the difference between the strike price (at exercise) and the prevailing market price and any premium paid to the holder to exercise the option. Also, the seller will lose the premium paid for entering into the option. The 'POTENTIAL LOSS' case:  In this case, should the holder of an option or call with a lower strike price than the prevailing market price decides to exercise the option, the holder will make a profit in terms of the difference between the strike price (at exercise) and the prevailing market price. However, the premium paid for entering into the option will reduce the profit by that amount. The seller of the option will suffer a loss in the form of the difference between the strike price (at exercise) and the prevailing market price. Also, the buyer will lose the premium paid for entering the option. The SELLER makes profits when: The buyer expires the call before expiry The buyer decides not to exercise the call before expiry even though the call is in the money at settlement The call is out of the money at expiry The LOSSER: When the Buyer doesn't exercise any options prior to expiry The buyer exercises the call before expiration prior to settlement on date at or out the money In order to get into the option contract, one needs to pay a premium which is usually known as the 'option premium'. It is an up-front cost charged at the inception of the contract. For the seller, the option premium received reduces the immediate loss that he makes on opening and closing the option position. You can also check out other types of option contracts like the 'American' option, 'European' option, 'exercise' option, 'sell' option, 'swap' option, etc. Option contracts are used by the corporations for protecting themselves from unfavourable events like a currency fluctuations, unrealized losses, etc. However, the financial institutions and individuals use option contracts for speculative purpose by placing bets on future values of underlying securities. For example, if you think that the Gold price will rise in future and you wish to bet more on it then you can buy a call option to buy gold at a future date. The seller of the call option will take the opposite view, i.e. Gold falling, in such an instance selling a large quantity of calls. Please note that the option premium is charged by","What you're describing is an example of selling a ""covered call."" A covered call means that when you write (""sell"") a call option, you hold the equivalent of the stock shares you're obligated to deliver.  Option trading is an example of a very complex market, and as such, there are many nuances and pitfalls. As an example, suppose the S&P futures contract closed at $1,700 one day.  If you held a call option on the S&P with a strike price of $1,800, and the option contract were 50 contracts, then the 50 contracts could give you $12 million at expiration. If you used that $12 million to purchase 60,000 shares of S&P, and were at some later point forced to take delivery of the 50 contracts, then you would have to purchase around 20 million shares of S&P to cover your obligation. If the underlying market continued to fall, you could find yourself in trouble as some other individual may be exercising the call option, which would force you to purchase 20 million shares of a falling market.   There are many, many pitfalls in options trading, and the market itself is quite complex. To answer one of your questions, yes, you can use options to do the opposite of what you suggest, which is buy stock. The pitfall in these types of trades is that if the market moves against you, you can find yourself in a very difficult spot, as options can have unlimited gains on them.  In practice, for every winner, there is also a loser. You don't have to be so pessimistic to see that there is potential for losses in options trading; you only have to watch the news."
[INST] How to work around the Owner Occupancy Affidavit to buy another home in less than a year? [/INST],"The first thing to keep in mind is that you said you are not living in the property. Therefore you will not qualify as an owner occupant. You will still have to sign the Owner Occupied Affidavit, however you do have several options: A first time homebuyer loan (Freddie Mac Borrower Information Sheet on First Time Homebuyers) or State HFA (Housing and Financing Agencies) First Time Homebuyers assistance program (See Freddie Mac Borrower Information Sheet on State Housing Programs). You will need to check to make sure that these are loans that you qualify for as a Veteran. They are typically income limited loans (you may or may not meet these requirements as well). The Freddie Mac Borrower Information Sheets, as well as their HFA First Time Homebuyers Programs page. These provide a good set of background information for the various types of loans that are available, however this is not a complete list of all the options available. Most of these options are considered to be ""special circumstances"". This will require that lender to do a lot of manual reviews of your options, which can sometimes take considerable time. The first option of the Owner Occupied Affidavit will be to have additional income added to your primary residence. This means that you would have to get the property currently listed as your primary residence listed as a rental property and have income added in from that property. This may be difficult if you are self employed depending on the state's laws on income requirements, especially if you are a new business owner where you have yet to get that established.","The bank requires you to be a homeowner because they want to see a solid pattern of employment and payment history.  As long as you can prove that you paid your rent/mortgage on time, and you can show 6 months of receipts, then you're golden. Income does matter, but it should also be fairly consistent between year's end (December 31 st), if you don't receive bonuses, your income typically will be about the same.  This is especially true for government employees, which they require to be in employment for at least 3 years to qualify for the loan. In short, yes, you will find a bank to qualify and finance you the right way, you just need to prove all of the income statements."
[INST] Purchase same stock twice [/INST],"There's no practical way to achieve this. The broker's system will not allow two trades that would result in the same positions. So you could sell two shares and then both buy two, but the system only lets you buy or sell the same number. If you then sold the first share, there'd be no way to tell the broker which share you expected it to sell. Brokers don't want to make special handling exceptions for this and the risk of incorrectly managing special handling exemptions. It really makes no sense as a practical option.","There are different ways to describe a trade (or a group of trades) that may accomplish what you like.  For example, you could do: a) buy 100 at X, sell 110 at X+1, this is a cashless collar, an example see http://www.portfolioplanneronline.net/Portfolio/PortfolioDetails/366610.aspx  b) purchase on margin, then get the margin called at X+1. A margin call will force you to sell something you own so will effectively accomplish this. c) sell short at X, buy at X+1, this is a net zero cash transaction, example see http://www.portfolioplanneronline.net/Portfolio/PortfolioDetails/366736.aspx An example with your preferred outcome is the following trade.

[INST] My investment account is increasingly and significantly underperforming vs. the S&P 500. What should I do? [/INST],"How much do you know about investing? How much are you investing? How are you investing?  You really need to be more thorough and specific in the questions you ask.  But first: If you're really interested in doing this properly, I suggest you buy my book (Disclosure: I wrote it), ""Stock Investing for the Average Person"".  It doesn't matter how great the product, there are too many salespeople (i.e. brokers) pretending to be financial advisors to tell you what stock you should buy.  Your portfolio should be diversified, and your decisions should not be made by just one person. Most investors, particularly retail investors, are at a huge disadvantage because, due to time and knowledge constraints, they follow the herd.  Instead of waiting for stock prices to fall so they can take advantage of a down market (which most people never do because they can't control their emotions), you should buy every month, through good and bad.  With this strategy, you are bound to realize excellent returns over the long term.  Unfortunately, however, most investors fail to realize that the long term is decades if not generations, and the markets are so efficient that there's little chance of you out-performing the indices for any period of time, no matter how smart they think they are.  So just go find a low-cost index mutual fund company like Vanguard and invest in their S&P500 Index fund or other appropriate fund and invest in it.  Every month.  That's it.","I agree with Tushar that the performance differences are so small that they're not significant, but there are other factors to consider. First, that -5% return is just over the last year.  What about the previous 11 years, 8 of which have been excellent? Second, you are invested in a total market portfolio, what is that return you are comparing against in the 500?  I would be curious how a balanced account (50% US large cap/50% US total bond) versus the 35% US large cap/balance of the total market portfolio.  Last, are you comparing this last year against historical returns, or the returns generated by your mutual fund portfolio?  If the returns aren't as good historically, you are comparing against the wrong standard.  The right one to use is the funds historical returns. There are several factors I would consider, but I don't think there is an issue worth getting your back up about.  Your returns can be explained by a few factors."
"[INST] When a stock price goes down, does the money just disappears into thin air? [/INST]","The money doesn't disappear in the sense that is doesn't disappear. The money that you thought you had when you bought the stock becomes money you spent when you sell it. So, you gave the shareholder more money than he got the last time. And then when he sells that share someone else gets more money than they paid (more than they thought they were getting). It's a transfer of ownership. The money doesn't vanish.","Actually it's the dividends that may get lower due to increased dividend payouts being done or if the company decides not to pay out to its shareholders or a large chunk of its profits is going to be reinvested back into company. One example has already been quoted about banks. As per my understanding what's the difference between dividend and share repurchase? Well there are different companies which pay dividends, some have dividend payout scheme and some don't. But generally speaking dividends are paid out from profit after the taxes are paid out , if the company makes profits year after year and they pay out dividends year after year (assuming there's nothing else to be considered as the dividend payouts are lower than the profits) then it would seem as if the stock price has a great potential to have increased as the company has made profits consistently and has paid out dividends consistently. But these dividends are paid out at the same time they are earned so they do not impact the value of the company (as the profits made are not used for investment for the future growth and expansion). So this type of dividend payouts do not cause any decrease in the intrinsic value of the company. But when it comes to share repurchase it's different, when a company says that they are going to buy back its own share, it's not really the case. The company buys for the shares from open market and cancels the shares purchased back from its market capitalization, thus reducing the number of outstanding shares in the open market, thus causing the share prices to be driven up. This is done when the company has excess profits and they want to share it with its stake holders. But when the company decides to reduce the shareholder's stake by reducing the number of shares in the outstanding shares, the shareholders looses some value, as there's smaller number of shares which can be sold in the market. Also if you notice the amount of outstanding shares has been reduced in absolute terms (because the value of the share has gone up and the number of outstanding shares is now lower) so the company has not really lost value, it may be the shareholder who's lost some value. And now, when the value of the shares go up, they'll be trading at higher prices. It is the investors who own the shares who lose money from a share repurchase because they either get less shares from the company after the repurchase (and thus lose value) or they end up selling their shares for less than they paid for them, at least in the short-term."
[INST] Why is OkPay not allowed in the United States? [/INST],"The reason is, most likely, simple: US regulations do not allow such a service to be offered from non-US companies (to US citizens). You should look at the terms of service to US citizens for any other payment system similar to OkPay and notice that ""only domestic banks can receive money for payments"". This rule has been in effect for quite some time and is meant to regulate the money laundering that is happening in the ""off-shores"" which the US citizens can't access. I hope this helps. I wish I had an answer for this question.","The issue is that it was a case of someone trying to do it before the laws were passed to prevent it. When the laws were written it was a grey area and people were doing it before it was illegal. Then they got punished for doing something which was not illegal at the time. To put it in perspective, there was a major bank in the UK who were processing these transactions and were punished for doing so. You can find a number of forums and threads about OKPAY on the net as it was an interesting legal case. It is more of an example that the regulators will not be flexible and it is worth taking on board if you are looking to set up a similar service as others have got it very wrong indeed."
[INST] Why have I never seen a stock split? [/INST],"Some companies have only ever split their stock once.  See Yahoo Finance and Google Finance, for example. Other companies like Apple seem to split their stock occasionally, at around $600/share; their current price is around $140 and seems to be around $100 in Feb. 2012.  Of course, they might have changed this over the past several years.  Apple used to split its stock to prevent it getting too high an actual price, though investors could always buy fractional shares, which seemed to do little or nothing for market interest when I could see my shares, bought as 100/110, in 2003, had grown a couple notches in the 'X of 1000' column. (They seem to have grown by 10 since 2003.)   But if you own shares, dividends, and stock splits, while interesting, are not the main issue of investing.  What is important is buying shares you believe in in companies you know and understanding the whole, such as why dividends are issued and reinvested at appropriate values if the company has good prospects.  But of course the issue is really what you believe the company is worth and in what proportion you value the company's ownership as relative to the rest of its assets, such as the market value of its debt.  Of course some companies have issued so many shares the dividend seems to rise with the price though in fact, with the stock split, it is the dividends and its frequency that should count for more than the actual number of shares.","A stock split is a ""re-distribution"" of ownership units in a company. The board of directors of a company will occasionally authorize a stock split if the share price of their company's stock has reached a level that seems too high as compared to industry, competitor and even historical standards. In some cases, this may put the share price at a level that the brokerage house, or even the investor's employer may no longer support. Typically, when a split occurs, the company will reduce the number of shares issued to each share holder. It will not be dilutive to any share holder as they still hold the same relative proportion of ownership in the company. In the case of a 2-1 split, every share holder would now have 2 shares for every share they had previously owned. So, if you had 1 share of XYZ before the stock split, you now have 2 shares. And the price of XYZ is now 1/2 what it was right after the split. The stock split process is usually accomplished prior to the stock trading on the open market. Typically, the stock will trade on a ""split-adjusted"" basis. So, if you hold one share of XYZ, you will now have 2 shares of XYZ. Your broker, or online broker may choose to ""split"" your shares for you. It is always best to consult your broker to learn all the details of the process in each particular case."
[INST] Income tax on my online drop-shipping business (India) [/INST],"Unless you have an international business, your business will not be liable for paying corporate taxes, it will be liable for being registered in a foreign country, and that is not something you want to do for the sake of making some money on the side. India does not offer much in comparison to local competition in terms of business. It will be difficult to beat local prices because of the exchange rate (which, by the way, is a mess right now). Your website will also have to be kept up by you or someone you employ. There are other options besides this. You can do this:","Whether your income gets taxed in India or not depends on the nature of your business. If your activity involves import of goods, then the same is taxable by customs duties. You can also be taxed in India for selling in India. All the above depends on the contract with your business partner. Since you did not mention whether you sell/distribute exclusively goods, it is difficult to say whether the same will have effect on your tax liability or not. In India there are many categories in which goods are taxed and if you do not import the same as part of taxable event then same is not taxable in India. In case of online income, if the income has foreign sourcing, same is taxed as Foreign Income and has specific provisions (such as deemed profits for unprofessional income). Also, in India in case of non-professional income, you are also required to get your taxes verified by a CPA (Chartered Accountant) in India from his fee and so in case of foreign income it is to be verified from a Chartered Accountant. Again whether such income will be taxed in India or not depends upon various aspects and for that you need to consult a tax professional."
"[INST] Company A is buying company B, what happens to the stock? [/INST]","The company A buys company B and they need cash for it, in the case of Xerox the company borrowed money so there are debt to repay. Once the acquisition is closed and the share exchange is complete, the company B shares will be replaced with shares in the acquiring company. No new shares are sold.  As long as the share exchange is at the same ratio no shares are issued; a 1:5 conversion means that every share in B is converted into 1 share in A; no additional shares are issued.   If you own company B shares you should have heard from the company or a broker who held the shares for you about the proposed acquisition and the options available for dealing with it.","The shares of Company B would typically be exchanged for shares of Company A. This would normally be a 1 to 1 exchange, i.e. 1 share of Company B would be exchanged for 1 share of Company A. The share price for Company A would normally go up, although only time will tell how much up it will go. In fact, both the shares will normally perform a share split, with typically 2 old shares for ever new share. This means in both B and A, the share price will reduce by half and the number of shares should double. This is basically a case of merger (not takeover). You can read much more about this on the wiki page for a Share Merger. Also see this question for merging of stocks - Merging and consolidation of a public company. From the last paragraph of the article, it looks like the management and board of both the companies have signed off on the deal. However, it does have a lot of paperwork before it comes into effect. The two links explain in much more detail what happens to shares when a company is taken over. (Note: Merger and Takeover are different, however, if Company A is going private, it would not be a takeover, as the company will no longer be publicly traded. Hence, this answers to ""If I was an investor, how smart would it be to sell my stock at this point?"" would be 'There's no harm in selling at this point because the transaction will take a while to go through, but you might be missing out on the upside.')."
[INST] Organizing Expenses/Income/Personal Finance Documents (Paperless Office) [/INST],"My wife and I currently use Mvelopes.com to categorize our expenses, create and track a budget and to pay bills.  You can see a breakdown of our budgeted vs. spent at anytime, and it will tell you what percentage you are over or under your budget when you enter a bill or purchase.  It works similar to Mvelopes.com, but has some unique features: http://www.creditkarma.com/spending  If you need to track expenses from 20+ years ago (like I do), You can look it up on my.creditkarma.com/spending/lookup - enter the date (you can narrow it down to day/month, month/year, or year/year), and you can see what your spending was each month!  The tool will also tell you the average of your last few months.  I'm not sure if CreditKarma will pull the category into Mvelopes, but you can easily email it to your inbox where you would copy & paste into Mvelopes.  My wife and I used to use the ""Envelopes"" feature in Mvelopes to budget for our expenses, but it was tough since we rarely had cash on hand.  Instead, we used the virtual envelope feature, and we've been very successful with it.  I like it a lot.","Since I'm already doing it, I thought I'd share. I am an accountant/tax adviser, and I do all this from my desktop computer. I have a folder called ""My Personal Records"" and a sub-folder for ""Bank Statements.""

[INST] Discussing stock and stock index movement: clarifying percentage vs. points? [/INST],"When someone is talking about the S&P 100 going up 10 points, they are not talking about one of the stocks in the index. They are talking about the overall index. So if 10 of the stocks of the 100 rise, each 1 point, the index rises 10 points. When the market indexes are talking about percentages they are talking about the change in the index from when you purchased it: So if you have a stock index tracking fund, and it was worth $100 1 year ago, and you are looking at it today and it is worth $150, it went up by 50%, not 150 points.","The price of anything generally moves up and down.  But since price movements are small relative to the price of the item itself (e.g. for stocks, the price of a share of stock may be $50 or $100, so a price change of, say, 50¢ is about a 1% move) the percent change becomes an important factor. A percentage change is just the amount of the change (e.g. 50¢) divided by the price (e.g. $100). You would see the symbol used this way: %ΔPrice = (Change in Price) / Price  where   %ΔPrice = percentage price change. So, in the case of the Apple stock, the $5.09 price movement is a 5.2% change because that's divided by $96.06. Since an individual stock price changes a lot, people sometimes watch an index of stocks, instead. Such an index contains values which are computed from the values of the different individual stocks, often in a weighted manner. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index just sums up the current prices of 30 particular stocks. So if that index closes at a value of 16100, then the index closed higher on the day if it closed at 16101 than if it closed at 16099. Because an index such as the DJIA is a weighted sum (each stock's weight is its share price) the same 50¢ change by each of the 30 stocks in effect makes the index move upward by $50 / 15000. The percent change of the index is the percent change of each individual stock, and so they each move the same percentage. You sometimes hear a TV commentator say that the stock market (or an index) closes lower or rises higher ""by x points"". This is the amount by which the index moved, and it's just the change in the index multiplied by your definition of a point. E.g., if you defined a point as 5 points then the value of a point is just the percent change of $5/$100. These things get very confusing because there are two different price levels to deal with: your initial price when you buy or sell, and the level the stock closes for the day. You could buy the stock for $100 and find that it closes the day at $102 and move to get out of the stock, and in your mind both your gain (or loss) and the change in the value of the stock, if you look before tomorrow's market opens, would be $2, or a change of 2%. But the price you sold at would be $102, while the closing price is only $100, and that's the price at which people would trade tomorrow. So, if you were a buyer, you might get a price of $102. The buyer sees your $2 gain as the stock moving up only $2, because he bought it at the closing price and your sell is a point, not a percent change. So if you define the index as, say the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), you would look at its current number and calculate the percent change by comparing it to the prior day's number.  E.g. if you read 16050 on Monday and 16090 on Tuesday, you might say the market rose by ""90 minus 50 or 40 points"" and calculate 40 / 16000*100 = 2.5% as the change in index from Monday to Tuesday. The buyer (or seller) of the individual stocks would see it as, if the buyer bought on Monday when the close was 16090 and sold on Tuesday when the close was 16050, he'd say the price rose from $10 to $10.55 or 55 point.   All this is just to illustrate that ""points"" and ""percentages"" can both mean things that the non-financially literate can easily lose track of.  That's why this gets confusing. You can go to various websites and look at the closing value of a stock or an index, and that's what you should be using as a guide. And I just looked up the number of companies in the DJIA, and it turns out that now that number is 30, so the DJIA closed at (16112.30 - 16090.85) / 3"
[INST] Can extra mortgage payments be made to lower the monthly payment amount? [/INST],"Yes, typically extra payments (over your normal payment) will be applied to your principal. However, your payment will not change unless you make extra payments. So, no, mortgagees do not do this.","I think the simple answer is that if it weren't possible to accelerate your debt repayment in this manner then the mortgage lender would not allow you to make the payments. In reality they are probably losing out on interest fees but what they probably want more is for you to have the incentive to keep up the payments since they may have to eventually deal with a bankruptcy or foreclosure situation. You should be thankful that they're offering you this option. If you're not sure if it's possible to have the extra payoff applied to the loans principle you should ask your originating lender if they will allow you to apply the money this way. You're best bet is to have everything laid out in writing. I'm not sure why you would want to apply the extra payoff towards the monthly payment amount (unless you have some specific reason), but you can always just pay the entire amount of the monthly statement due."
[INST] Claiming business expense from personal credit card [/INST],"From my understanding of how this is supposed to work, it's not a credit card expense that you're claiming, it's an allowable expense incurred in the course of running your business. If you use a credit card to pay that allowable expense, then you can reclaim it as a business expense, and the business part of it will reduce the amount of profit earned on the business, hence reducing the amount of tax you pay. So claiming a business expense on a personal card should not be a problem - you can use whatever works best for you. Some expenses might not be eligible for claiming - there are requirements to support the expense (like you can't claim for personal use, or for things like alcohol etc.) - so make sure that you understand what can and cannot be claimed, and keep good records so you can prove what you're claiming if the tax man wants to know.","No, the personal credit card cannot be deducted because the business expenses are not associated with the payment of a business debt (such as paying for a computer that is used for performing services for the business). Further, the fact that he charged the expenses on a personal card does not mean that the business will not use the item. For example, you can buy a computer for your business's use and then decide to charge something else on the same card if you want. There is nothing in the accounting books to say that you can't and in some cases it may be desired for the two accounts to be able to interact for some internal accounting reasons. However, this is not a case that the credit card issuer allowed you to use your business' account on your personal credit card. The account should be clearly identified as business property and not mixed with business accounts. For example, if you own a restaurant you should have your cashier use their own personal account to purchase coffee beans from a supplier for the restaurant that the cashier may have an account with. It may seem to make sense to charge it under the business account (I.E., the business pays the coffee beans supplier), but from an accounting book perspective, they are still the same thing. It would cause major issues to try using the two accounts interchangeably when the expense has been recorded in more than one set of books."
[INST] Can a trade happen “in between” the bid and ask price? [/INST],"The answer is yes. There are many factors that can come into play. One is called a market order. I've included an example and a link: http://www.tradeking.com/en-us/investing-education/investor-center/article/aapl.marketorder.aspx?s=aapl&e=224947096&isbn=TK1901 This article explains a different type of trade where I believe the ""in between"" you are referring to is what is actually taking place. Basically someone with a market order is willing to buy/sell at any price. At the beginning of a day when no trades had been made yet, if someone places a trade of 1000 shares at a price .30 cents below the bid and their order is chosen by the algorithm before the bid or ask had time to clear then the trade will take place at that price. The ""in-between"" you observed can also be observed between bids and asks. In between a bid and an ask are people called 'market makers'. Market makers basically take a gamble on whether there will be other orders coming in to take the position the market maker is offering. Market makers take a gamble on price and time. If they think the price will go up they will want to buy low, if they think it will go down they will want to sell high.  For more information on market makers check this link: https://www.investorwords.com/1234/market_maker.html","Yes, it must be like that, that the transactions happen between ""offers"", right?  Otherwise, what the use of orders to ask and bid?   Consider the following scenario (explanation below): Assume no liquidity after the first transaction. The order gets filled below the ask and higher   than the bid. Bid (market order) is fully filled. Then ask is fulfilled from   both sides. Last transaction is fulfilled below the ask price. Is the third   transaction not fulfilled from the ask and instead filled above the bid?"
[INST] Should I fund a move by borrowing or selling other property assets? [/INST],"There are a hundred different answers. A) You are a very cautious person.  You have a mortgage (possibly for the property with the cash in the bank) and are paying interest on it.  You have a mortgage with a monthly payment which is not a ""burner"" such that you will have a hard time paying it.  You are making some repairs to increase value.  This sounds like a reasonable mortgage, as a mortgage is a sound investment.  Your cash is a sound investment.  But you don't want to risk your cash investment or mortgage payments to buy something that might be a bad investment - so you are considering a safer option. B)  You are in a place (physically) where property values are very high.  This suggests that you have a good income, in order to make the mortgage payments.   There are other reasons, but these are the ones that have led me to make my answer.","You did not say why you want to sell the other house, but the best answer on selling house to fund moving is: The answer to moving because of a job does not require the sale of the other house though.  If your salary increase is sufficient to handle the move, you should not need to sell current home unless you are paying Pitiful Interest or you are looking to sell to pay off credit cards.   So you sell either to pay off credit, or to stop paying pitiful interest or for some other reason that does not depend heavily on the salary increase.   You can try to talk to your employer about the cost of moving for a job.  The cost of moving can be significant.  But the employer may cover this cost if there is no financial reason to do so, or if it makes them more money in the long run. However, most employers will not.  The cost of moving is the employee's cost, typically. But when the benefit is higher wages, the employer may have to choose between higher wages or a move and may choose to pass on the cost. You need to think about the other costs you may incur in moving.  The sale of the house will take, generally, 6 months.  You can not sell it quicker than that.   You may incur a lot of other moving cost, such as a new car -- if your current car dies soon enough that you will need a new car by the time you move. This may actually be good.  By having the extra cash right now you can set yourself up for the future.   What to do about the pitiful interest / Credit card debts.  If you keep up this rate of paying, you will have this debt paid off in about one year.  That's a really quick payoff.  But if you need a new car to move, you need to have some debt left over for the car. Is there anything you can sell to offset the costs so you can put the entire windfall against the Credit card?  Or even sell house first instead.   If you need to keep both debt and mortgage (house), you can either sell now and put more of your windfall against the house, or you can make bigger monthly payments to pay off the debt earlier so the debt is more manageable.   You need to take into account that the new property taxes you would pay would include additional interest rate costs if you are borrowing -- including the interest incurred due to the short term loan for the downpayment and the cost of taking on more housing loan debt because you need to live there. (Note that there can be some mortgage discounts from lenders for people who live in the house versus rental investors. So the interest rate you pay on the mortgage can be higher if it is investment rather then owner occupied.) The sale of the house would be your main benefit -- since with home improvements you should be able to get this within the 6 months range. If you can buy a house before the 6 months (which is not common) then you are basically saving the moving costs + a months worth of home costs. However you need to keep in mind that it will likely cost you more to sell a house -- if you do need to move from one place to another, you are essentially paying both places for 2 months.  If you need to move in a hurry, then by selling ahead of time, you get stuck paying 3 mortgage payments (you take the hit the entire time the house is in escrow + 1 month of the new mortgage in the new place) so you may actually have some savings if you just move. If it were me, I would try for something like a 401k/Roth loan to get me through the 6 months period.  I know it is high cost to pay, but since your cost for the entire time (2.5 months interest + mortgage payment + 2.5 months mortgage payment + 2.5 months interest + mortgage payment + 3 months mortgage) is so much higher, that a 401k is actually a cheaper way. It's better if you own it outright but sometimes you have no choice. I'd also move without waiting 6 months if I could afford the double time and the selling price is high enough to cover more than buying.  You need to do the math. The math will change depending on whether there are other houses you could rent in the meantime while the sale is going through (since they do take up to 6 months.) If you sell before moving, then you don't have anything to occupy, so you will move into your existing house (which you have 6 months escrow) and rent out the previous house.  However, if you plan to rent out the previous house, then the rent income would cover the mortgage"
[INST] Sage Instant Accounts or Quickbooks? [/INST],"There are also a few important considerations to make in this decision, some already mentioned in the comments, but I think these are often ignored: There are a variety of software products built around QuickBooks data, e.g. for forecasting, budgeting and payroll.  If you need to take advantage of any of these, stick to QuickBooks as the accounting engine. Accounting isn't a free lunch, if you want to do everything else right there are some costs or tradeoffs.   If you need to run QuickBooks off site (or use it in a multi-site or multi-office use), consider the cost of accessing it via a server or over the Internet.  Sage's server edition runs $999/site, and QuickBooks uses remote access solutions that vary in price depending on how many connections you need, or can get access across with VPN.  You may be better off hosting locally and opening the accounting up to remote access for just one site, or using web-based accountants.","I have a home-based business, and QuickBooks Online has been a life saver in terms of keeping track of business income/expenses. I know the QB online free version doesn't exist anymore, so we're stuck with the $9.99/month fee. It's more than worth it for us at the moment. For us, it definitely streamlines our accounting process. It's definitely worth a try, given that the free version might work out well enough for you."
[INST] Prepaying a loan: Shouldn't the interest be recalculated like a shorter loan? [/INST],"I think you are asking about a different situation. You said you made payments on this loan, and made the loan payment early.  At this point, how is this going to be handled depends on many factors.  Some of them I will address, but not all of them and not all the details. Is it a FHA loan? Is it a student loan? Is it an installment loan from a bank? Is it a loan between individuals? Is it an auto loan? What happened to the loan agreement? Is the loan still active, or paid off, or refinanced, or sold?  What is the interest rate on the loan? Do you remember the monthly payment, and how much did you pay of each payment? I don't know of any bank or lender or servicer that lets you pay interest out of principal. In a refinance situation, if there is prepayment, the refinanced payment will generally be less than the original principal payment, and it will shorten the term of the loan. If the time period of the payments is the same then the payment would be more. This means that the interest will be less each month. The interest may, or may not, be recalculated down after each payment is applied to principal after it has been made.  Generally there is a penalty that will be charged to the borrower for paying off the loan early. That is to compensate the lender for the loss of interest income that was to be paid to the lender. Usually this is a small amount, compared to the total loan. But, what this means is that the penalty needs to be subtracted from the total loan interest paid. This isn't automatic, and it depends on the loan and agreement. You may need to ask the lender to do it, and see what they say.  If there was a penalty, then the total amount paid may be more than the payments made. If this is the case, and if you understand the details of your agreement, then you may have to pay the penalty for paying the loan too early to make sure all the principal is paid, so that you don't go into a deficit and end up paying the finance charge again.  All that said, I would generally not consider a personal loan to a friend or family member to be an investment opportunity, but consider it a cost of doing business. You made them happy (I hope) that you were able to get them out of the situation they were in. I would not expect them to pay you back any more than they already promised, or to make interest payments on an informal arrangement.","To calculate the effective interest of a loan, we need to account for the compounding of interest. This means that the amount that is being calculated is not equal to the amount borrowed. Compounding also affects the principal value of loans where payments are a certain amount rather than interest-only. The formula for compounded interest looks somewhat complex, but isn't too bad once you realize what it is trying to show. The value of Xn, where n is the number of compounding periods, is what you expect it to be (principal + interest) and P is the principal (i.e.: the amount borrowed is what we are compounding upon): Xn = P × (1 + r/n) n At the time that payments are being made, X = Xn, and when your next payment is due, (Xn+1)/n is equal to Xn. You can see that this new value will be greater than Xn because (1 + r/n + r/n^2 + r/n^3 + r/n^4) will be larger than (1 + r/n). As such, your loan will be larger than it appears. As to the actual question though, you are right that as more is paid off, you are reducing the total interest, but you are now using the interest-only payments to reduce the principal, so the interest is compounded upon a lower loan which means that you have even more interest to pay. As such, you can make the payments either by paying more by $ amounts (i.e.: paying more than the interest-only amount of the payment) or by paying early. The actual payment is P*r + r*P*(1-n+n^2/2-n^3/3+n^4/4) for a loan compounded annually and P*r + r*P*(1-n^2/2+n^4/4) for a loan compounded monthly. So you can calculate what you have paid (in terms of interest) and how long it will take based on the payment amount and how often it is being compounded. This is why (although paying a little more at a time is preferable to making a one-time payment that increases the principal only), making multiple $ payments spread out is usually preferable to making payments all at once and increasing the principal."
[INST] How much life insurance do I need? [/INST],"I've found in general people get far too much life insurance. They insure themselves 15-20 times their income, and as an insurance broker I've seen people go up to 40 times their income.   If you are only buying insurance to provide your family money if you die they think the amount you need is equal to 25-30 times the income you would likely be working if you were around and contributing today. But then they add other things to the calculation like the mortgage on your house, education money, a new car, and so on. This is wrong. Here are the right numbers.   Income Insurance: 10 times income, and nothing higher Income insurance is what your insurance is meant for. It is supposed to replace your income if you die, assuming you are insuring yourself at a time you are healthy. Income insurance is really only necessary if you have dependents. So if you have a wife and two kids you need 25 thousand dollars annually, if you have the kids and are single you need 20k annually. If you have no dependents it should stop there, period, if you need more insurance then you are doing it wrong. Life insurance is supposed to provide for your dependents if they were still dependent on your ability to provide financially and then disappear. If you had no dependents when you died, then no insurance would probably have been better than the wrong type of insurance, because it did nothing to help those left behind.  Insurance providers want to sell you life insurance like a financial advisor wants to sell you retirement plans, mutual funds, and so on. So the first mistake most people making is buying life insurance from the insurance company and not getting advice on it first. There is something called a Risk Class that you get and can be very useful in ensuring you get a fair price. If you are an average Joe then any company will give you exactly the same risk class and insurance price. However if you are someone like a smoker, an athlete, someone who does extreme sports, you may get different risk classes. As an example I know someone who is a firefighter, he is also a smoker, and had a terrible risk class. So he couldn't buy life insurance from any of the insurance companies in Canada. Instead he found one insurance company that could give him a better deal because they had a better feel for his risk class and got him a decent rate.  This leads to mistakes two. If your job has a high risk then you are wasting money buying a huge term policy from an Insurance company because the same company will be offering you a policy at the right amount and at a much better price. They want a cut of your profit and will give you a special policy for a higher premium that will make them better off as a company. If your company will sell you insurance, even at a high rate, you will come out ahead simply because you are getting the full value of your risk. As an example one insurance companies only offered me a price of $38,000 a year for life insurance. I was a good candidate for this insurance as I am in my mid thirties and perfectly healthy. They have policies that range from the 38 to 250 thousand depending on the age and risk class of the person being insured. So basically they would lose money, and not make money offering me insurance. Then I went to speak to an insurance broker and was able to get coverage for 3.5 times income with a different company at the same price. So instead of throwing away 10k you see here, the insurance broker got me a better rate by convincing their company to offer me an amount of insurance at a price that would still make them money on offering me an insurance policy.  Another reason to avoid buying insurance through your job is most policies that your job covers you for are only for the amount of your salary, not what you earn. So if you are making 60k, they will not insure you for 150k or so, it will be for only half of that.  This comes in handy if you are planning on building up a substantial amount of investment income through your working life. With the extra money you aren't paying in insurance premiums you can invest up to 15-20% of your income depending on how much you like to pay in taxes and see it grow if you wish.  Finally the best advice I can give you is to get a good insurance broker to help you get the insurance policy and to make sure it makes sense, you will find that life insurance sales people in insurance companies and the like can be incredibly aggressive and will tell you anything to convince you to buy a policy. You need someone representing","The answer to this type of question usually is the ""what will happen to your family if you become a casualty. This is usually best answered with the question of; What is your ""Today's Income"", and What is your ""Tomorrows Income"", and What is your ""Tomorrow's Expenses"" (including ""Future Costs"" such as college tuition). Your ""Tomorrow's income"" is usually the highest you will earn. That is the income that you want to replace. At the same time, you need to understand what your ""Tomorrow's expenses' are likely to be and the future cost of such things as education for your children.  This does not apply to all equally so it is important to know what will be taken out of your ""Tomorrow's income"" for income tax purposes, your other living expenses (including savings & investment), your retirement savings (including employer retirement plan contributions), and other family obligations such as parents, grandparents, other relatives, possibly charity, etc. You must also know the ""cost"" of your current income including the income tax consequences, other taxes (health, social security, etc), and any special conditions that impact your employment like job security and future increases, pension expectations, and any other retirement planning that may help you know what you have planned for your retirement. At the same time, you need to consider ""What will happen when you leave?"" (when you lose your income) so that you know what life will be like for your survivors.  The idea of life insurance is to make life less hard for your family/survivors with a fixed asset of cash, and to help pay off any fixed liabilities such as a mortgage, business loans, other loans, and any other obligations. Many people do not understand that insurance, is not a speculative investment. As a life insurance policy matures,  it becomes more valuable as the insured passes their prime and becomes more dependent upon the policy to secure a comfortable future. For children's policies it is usually a good idea to keep the policy current and pay the future premiums and maintain a fixed annuity for tuitions and/or investments."
[INST] How much life insurance do I need? [/INST],"I don't know if it's wise to simply add up your children's current ages to arrive at a sum. What about your wife's income being wiped out?  This calculation also assumes that your children are somehow ""out of college"" if they are 3 and 5 years old.  What about when they turn 20 and 16?  Would you consider their needs to be completely fulfilled at that age, regardless of their debt, college costs?  I'm just saying I'm not sure you really arrived at the amount you should buy based on that alone. Another thing:  your wife probably doesn't want to spend the rest of her life being a single mother.  How would you feel about that?  I would look to have life insurance that at least covers your income.  But I would also look at the income your wife contributes to household expenses and look at the insurance she provides for child care.  (Are you both doing 50/50 child care or are you at home, she at work?  Are your kids in child care or daycare?) You might very well need a lot of life insurance to cover that!  To figure that out, you might want to talk to a person, not a salesman, but that doesn't happen often anymore with insurance because salesmen pay the salaries of these agents.  If you just can't get anybody to give an honest assessment, consider some insurance calculators online.  Try ones that can run different scenarios to see what happens.","As a rule, you should determine how much life insurance you need by calculating your debt and income. This will give you a total, so you should figure out how long you will need coverage by figuring a mortgage term."
[INST] When are investments taxed? [/INST],"I believe capital gain is taxed when the stock is sold. So if you held $1000 of stocks, and then later bought it for $40 and held onto it, you will only pay tax on the capital gains between the $40 and $960. You paid only tax if you sell it for more than $960 (assuming you are in the USA).","In general, income taxation is done on taxable income, in order to achieve a progressive income tax. Thus, we typically use adjusted taxable income, which is gross income minus ""adjustments,"" so some forms of income are not taxed in their entirety. For example, the Social Security and Medicare taxes paid by an employer are deductible expenses for determining AGI or taxable income. However, wages on which the employer has paid Social Security FICA tax are included as wages. The wage subject to payroll taxes represents the taxable salary for Social Security tax. The Medicare tax is also based on the worker's salary. Similarly, dividends qualify for a special dividend exclusion -- which applies to both capital gains and stock dividends in some cases. Some interest earned on bonds is deductible, so the bond interest payments are taxable income. However, all interest, including mortgage principal payments, are used to qualify for the standard deduction -- which is the part of the income tax that is effectively a deduction. This all assumes that taxable income is the top-level figure for determining tax, but in reality, taxable income is subject to special adjustments. As the final form of the return is prepared by software, or if the taxpayer chooses to use an accountant, it's more likely that the correct amount of taxable income is used than if the taxpayer calculates taxable income using tax tables for each item of income. If the software or accountant calculates a different taxable income amount for a given filing status and income source than what the taxpayer calculated using the tax tables, then the software might choose the larger amount, or the accountant will pick the appropriate amount. This is how the tax software companies ensure that calculations are reliable."
[INST] What's the formula for profits and losses when I delta hedge? [/INST],"To add a little to the previous answers, the key to understanding delta hedging is to remember that hedging is in itself a simple option strategy known as a collar, which may also be called a spread collar.  Hedging is basically the purchase of a call and the sale of a put that are both at the same strike (in other words, the call and the put are part of a ""collar"") and also expire either at the same time (in this case, at the time of the expiry of the underlying security) or are part of a longer-term collar (e.g. where they expire on the same day at different times in the future).  What this means is that all it really comes down to is that your expected profit after hedging will be the difference between the two strike prices, and the cost of the option(s). In the option world, an option's sensitivity to movements in the underlying security is known as vega or beta gamma, but for simplicity, in this case we will just consider delta (i.e. the market price of the option at expiry is equal to the underlying security's price, so delta is effectively the ""market hedge"" that is used in finance as a proxy for an option). Thus, we can look at the case where you are paying a premium for the hedge, i.e.: Let P_c and P_p be the market prices of the call and the put respectively Let x_c and x_p be the strike prices of the call and the put respectively Let d_c and d_p be the deltas of the call and the put respectively Let t be the time between now and settlement The option prices can be written in a standard form where they are in the form of (market price - strike price)/delta where the price of the option is the market price minus what the option would be priced today. These two conditions can be written either in terms of the call price: or in terms of the put price: To simplify these equations, we can just subtract the strike price from both sides of the equations and rearrange the terms such that they are in terms of the delta of the put and that of the call The first condition becomes: The second condition becomes: Now, what does this mean? What we are essentially trying to say is that if the put is more expensive than the call and the two strike prices are the same, the put will have a lower delta than the call. In this case we are not necessarily talking about the intrinsic value, but the market price. This may seem confusing, especially at first: Why is the delta of the call higher than the put? But think about it: delta represents the amount the option's price at maturity will move if the underlying moves dollar 1, so if the option is priced lower than in intrinsic value, its delta at maturity will be lower! So basically, what we are really saying is that the put is trading higher than the call, while having lower delta. In simple terms, it should be obvious that what we are essentially looking at is an underpriced option with higher delta and an overpriced but mispriced option with lower delta. This is because of the time value. Since the put is higher than the call, it means that the time value for the put is higher than that of the call. Why, you may ask? Well, we know that the time value for an option is lower the closer it is to expiry, and that an option's value will decline to the intrinsic value closer to expiry.  Basically, what we are seeing here is that at maturity, the option's value will be the intrinsic value so its delta will be zero and its time value = 0 = money, and it will also be mispriced, as one option will be priced higher and one priced lower. So, for example, if we were to look only at time value for delta hedging over the short term, and nothing was mispriced, both put and call would have the same delta if expiry was closer, but as the options moved further away from expiry, the put's delta is still lower, because it still has time value, while the call's delta is zero because it is at the money, while it still has time value. So the time that the options have until expiry is causing the lower delta on the put, i.e.: the fact that it is trading lower but has higher time value. Basically, in the delta hedging world, what we are doing in the case of this strategy is going long the mispriced option (in terms of the time value, but not in terms of the intrinsic value","I may be missing something, but does the formula on this answer use dividends paid out, or the change in stock price by the date of dividends paid out? Dividends are normally paid out quarterly and are not predictable.  Also, the formulas do not explain how to obtain the change in stock price by dividend dates."
[INST] Should I pay off investment property mortgage [/INST],"If you can get a good deal on the refinancing (1.5%) then you can save 134.20 per month by paying the total in cash. This is not including taxes so you'd have to figure how much refinancing costs.  It may cost 3k and then you only save .26$ on payments. (.04k per year in payments versus 3k) Assuming you don't have the cash now, you could save that and pay it off at closing if you had a little more time. If you have little spare money for investing, why would you pay for the mortgage in cash?  Is there money lying around? Do you have a large IRA to put some the money in? Could you find another investment to buy that would be close the same return? The cash in the house is probably earning a better return than investing. The cash in the house is liquid if you have an emergency, but investments aren't. Are you selling the investment home because it is at the end of its useful life? It seems like you will be out $15k when the mortgage is paid off in 15ish years. You plan on selling in 6?  It's like you bought the house as an investment and didn't plan for the 3 year time frame you are selling in. If you plan on staying in it for 15 years, then refinancing makes no financial sense and you should use your savings for something else.","No you should NOT pay the mortgage balance off unless it also includes the interest payments.  Paying off your second mortgage of $40k leaves $80k owing.  On that amount you are paying interest @ 8.5% over a further 23 years.   Why would you lock yourself into that loan for all those years?  The property is in ""negative equity"" and needs improvements that you might like to put off until you have sufficient equity in the property to enable you to borrow or build from.  For example: How much can I get in a bank loan?  What does the loan need for collateral security?  How much interest is that loan if I borrow at 85% of the security?  How much cash must I deposit for the loan to be approved.   Can I refinance the mortgage and borrow extra?  Would refinancing provide me with sufficient extra money to make the renovations?  If the answer to both these questions is 'no' then you need to look for other sources of finance.  Look for investors willing to provide the funds to renovate your existing property.  The renovations should increase the price of your property by more than the cost of the renovations.  Once the renovations have been completed sell your property.  Use the funds to pay off your existing mortgage and purchase another investment property somewhere else."
[INST] Historical Stock Price Quote on delisted stock without knowing stock symbol as of quote date [/INST],"If you have the ticker symbol for a given date, you can pull the price or other information. However, you need to know the ticker symbols and dates before you can request the data.  If the data set you're looking for doesn't exist, you'll need to build it yourself.  For example, you can call Yahoo's Stock Quote API and pass a ticker symbol as a query string parameter.  Assuming your time zone is set correctly, it will return 100 rows of price data starting with the most recent.  You could simply iterate this, saving each row to a database.  You could then use those results to create your own ticker-symbol history list.  Once you have this history, you can make requests based on the symbol and date in your list.  You'll obviously get the results you expect and this is the method I would recommend.  Note that Yahoo's API does have a limitation of 50 calls per user per hour.  This should be more than sufficient if you are only building historical data for a handful of symbols or dates.  If you are retrieving every ticker symbol in existence, you would need to make sure you are throttling your requests.  If you make more than 50 calls, you'll exceed the limit and your requests will fail.  Note that this problem can get much more complex than storing a symbol list and querying the API for historical price data.  There are plenty of other questions on this site which help clarify these problems further.","As answered by DW635 and as referenced by mv122 in comment, the main difficulty is finding the correct name of the stock on Yahoo finance.  There seems to be a general lack of consistency between the ticker being used (even within Yahoo) and the ticker actually needed to get the stock price.  I used the Yahoo historical quotes tool to find the ticker name and the stock ticker, and the stock price is here."
[INST] What evidence or research suggests that mid- or small-capitalization stocks should perform better than large caps? [/INST],"First, we must understand the two different theories regarding large cap versus small cap.  Theory 1 is the ""value"" theory, that the market always undervalues these smaller companies, so in the long term, value in these smaller companies increases.   Theory 2 is that smaller companies are simply more volatile and riskier, and the stock returns and volatility tend to be directly proportional (the riskier it is, the higher the return).  These two ideas are not mutually exclusive and are both valid for some degree of truth.   What evidence is there?  As far as volatility and risk, you'll have to look around.   As far as value, you may want to look at studies such as Fama-French (Fama and French, 199) and other related research.  There is significant evidence to suggest that companies with high P/E ratios tend to significantly outperform those companies with low P/E ratios.    However, when choosing individual stocks of small caps, the stock market doesn't know the difference between good and bad stocks, and they do tend the pick stocks with high P/E's better than good, for the simple reason that good stocks become more popular and so the market tends to get the P/E more accurate, and then the good companies become more expensive. (That's why Warren Buffett likes to buy undervalued companies with low P/E's, like IBM, Coke, Dofens, and Wal-Mart stock - they are all low P/E's, and so the market will have to correct them to their rightful P/E later on.)   Of course, when choosing ETF's or mutual funds or index funds, the market simply doesn't know the difference between good small-capped companies and bad ones, and so the performance of a company will simply be the performance of the market, given the fact that all the fund holds is a bunch of small-capped companies.  So, in this sense, it's almost not worth bothering to investigate, because most of the gains you're getting in small cap funds in just the value of the index and not the individual companies.  However, the value of the index itself is still based on the value of individual companies.  So, it doesn't really matter which fund you buy, really, given how everything is all a zero sum game.  In the end, you're still going to pay exorbatant fees for all this information and all that expertise and what's it going to come down to? - you still would have done better buying index funds than managed ones, because those managed ones still have to do all their expertise to pick the best mix of stocks to do the best they can and then pay you 1.5% fees, or whatever, as opposed to just buying the index fund itself.   So, if you want to invest in a fund of these small-capped companies, there isn't much you can do, other than choose the one that charges the least fees so you can keep more of your returns for yourself - everything else is just a zero sum game.","There is a huge library of academic papers on the subject of the capitalization effect, and there are many contradictory results.  Most of the time, however, I come back to an old 1979 paper by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French: The Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns. The paper showed that, once you control for the size of the investment opportunity (as measured by the return to T-Bills) and the industry composition of the investment opportunity, there were very few other factors that predicted what the return to a specific company should be. They were very skeptical about how important some of the factors are: Value / growth, or momentum / trend-following. What we have seen since then is that there are so many other forces and influences at play, that the size itself is probably the biggest driver of risk and expected returns. Of course, as we look to today, the world has changed and in particular, the capitalization effect has waned significantly since even the late 2000s. For example, the following graph comes from the S&P Dow Indexes: The graph shows that the larger companies are taking more and more market share from smaller companies.  You'd think that's the opposite of what should be happening over time, but it's not.  I have a theory here: The smaller companies have more capital and expertise than ever, and they are doing a better job of not only surviving, but growing and innovating. The larger companies face a lot more scrutiny and are often stuck in old habits, or simply find it hard to innovate without getting bogged down in bureaucracy. If you are a small company, you have a lot less red tape and a lot more ability to try new things. The larger companies can get a lot more ""risk capacity"" if they wish and so they can invest more heavily in new products and new lines of business, but the red tape often gets in the way of that. In any case, while some of the research shows the size effect isn't as powerful now as it once was, there are still some good reasons to think that there probably is more risk associated with small and mid-cap stocks."
[INST] Risk to Reward Ratio Calculation [/INST],"Well, most important things are not included in any of the answers so far. If we are talking about stocks - there is another type of analysis than just risk to reward. Let's imagine that the stock has three possible outcomes over the course of year: it may go down 10%, go up 10% or stay the same. If you buy the stock today, then you should look at the current price to find a good number. We will assume that there is a total of $1,000,000,000 worth of this stock in the whole market, or a total float. Here is what you do: calculate the number of share the stock has: 1,000,000,000/current price number. This should tell you how many shares there are out there. Then calculate how much of these shares you will get for $10 a share. In percentage term, this means - you know what percentage of the total float do you own. In your mind, you should know exactly how many shares you have of this stock. The risk here is that the stock either goes down or stays the same. If you knew what was going to happen tomorrow, then you would know what your risk to reward is, because the other side you know the return is 50 cents or no change in price. Now, there is another thing you should consider. You are looking to buy just one share, so how many share is that? How does this help you or hurt you? You should look to buy at least 1% because now it will not hurt your percentage of total float too much, that is the most you can buy safely without moving the stock price. You are basically going to move the stock price now if you have over 10,000,000 shares. So, go ahead and calculate the risk to reward ratio with this scenario.","If the first trade is a 'gut move' and the second trade is based on the news that came out of that first trade, perhaps the best way to look at it is as a multi-leg order that consists of two unrelated trades. And, with this being the case, why would you bother with measuring your risk to reward ratio?  The main problem with measuring your risk to reward ratio on one combined order or trade is that you cannot accurately determine your potential gain on the second leg, because it is based on news that happened during the first leg, which would not have taken place had you not gotten into that first trade. You'll never be able to accurately determine how much you will make on your second leg, let alone how much you'll make if you take two legs into consideration. The only way you would be able to accurately determine your risk to reward ratio on a multi-leg order like this would be to consider it as a single trade, which you can't do because the second leg is based on news that came out of the first leg."
[INST] Why Demat/Stock Market Brokers don't support Credit Card Payin [/INST],"One answer to your question might be more in the ""who would be the issuer of the loan?"" than in inquiries for ""payments"".  That is, your credit card would be the issuer of the loan.  It might be possible for the credit card company itself to ""accept"" payments on your mortgage or car loan, where the primary bank accounts were with other banks.  Your card issuer would know about how much you owe other places. Asking why a credit card company would do that is a very different question from why a credit card company would accept the payments for somebody else's loan.  Credit card companies are not in the business of getting paid directly on auto loans or mortgages.",I suspect it's because of the transaction costs. They have to make it worth their while and that means there is a cut they want from the banks to transfer the funds in from your credit cards to their escrow accounts. It doesn't work for you either as in some countries you cannot use it to cover losses - so any losses may still count as debt against your limit. I suspect that they simply can't see why they would want to pay the credit card companies to handle such a lot of transaction and to pay them their cut when you are already using your credit card anyway.
[INST] Should I put more money down on one property and pay it off sooner or hold on to the cash? [/INST],"Unless there's some reason to think the real estate market is about to collapse, you might prefer to put that extra money into another property. That investment has the potential for upside, both in rent (maybe you find a higher-paying tenant, maybe the property is in a nice neighborhood where rents go up over time) and in appreciation (if the market continues to rise you're getting more for your money when you do sell). If you put more money on your current property, you basically get to pay down your principle faster: this gives you the potential for the same upside on rent, which is why most people pay more on their mortgage if they can, and no downside on appreciation (the value of the property, not the mortgage itself, should increase). However, if you invest in property #2 as you describe, you will have the same potential for monthly income, plus some potential for appreciation, and no potential to increase your principle faster than you normally would. It's really just an issue of comparing potential income now vs. potential income later. You can try and estimate the potential income for property #1, to compare. Maybe you get a 10% return (say, in rental income), which will be tax-deductible. Maybe property #2 has, say, a 6% return, not as tax-deductible. Maybe it has no potential for tax deductions at all. Then weigh those potentials against how you're doing on paying down your principle -- whether that's actually an advantage, and if so, how much of a difference it's made to you so far, if at all.","I'd rather pay the same dollar amount as I did for the down payment on the previous house every month into each successive house.  As with dividends, you're getting back that money in the form of equity.  A nice side effect is that each successive house's monthly payments go down as your mortgage is paid off.  You also have the option during your home renovations of building up a cash reserve of equity that you can access when your renovation costs are due (especially if the house has dropped in price over the period).  You may end up with a smaller net amount, of course, but that can be more than compensated for by the reduced monthly house outgoing.  And with property costs being lower now, you could reduce that monthly outgoing and still stay in the same location (which would make the renovations a bit harder).  It's a fine balancing act at present, I reckon."

[INST] Will depositing $10k+ checks each month raise red flags with the IRS? [/INST],"This is something to worry about.  The question you need to ask yourself is ""Is my business cash-based or not?  You have an obligation to the rest of your taxpayers to make reasonable efforts to insure that if money is involved, that it doesn't get lost, stolen or otherwise misappropriated.  There are certain types of businesses where money, especially cash, moves fast (liquor store, for example, or a small grocery.  There are certain businesses where cash moves slowly, at least for retail transactions (think of a lawn/garden supply store or a tool dealership).  If money moves fast in your business, you have to take some precautions to be sure money gets where it's supposed to get. Depositing ten thousand dollars a month in a non-bank business account that isn't used every day, won't, in this day of paperless banking and check imaging, raise suspicions of forged checks (unless they're from the same payor).  I suspect this is the worry you have.  You may have been told, though, that you can't pay (some) vendors via check and others with bank transfers, and the bank wants you to be able to show a long, cohesive payment history.  You may have to revert to paper checks if you don't, at the very least, explain why you have ""one vendor that gets paid every three months via direct deposit, one vendor that gets paid every few weeks with cash, and one vendor that gets paid twice a year with a single massive check, etc"".  There are certain transactions that I find highly irregular.  2001:  My new business partner tells me that he's been the beneficiary of an inheritance, so we won't be having a problem with access to funds, at least not for a couple years, because the inheritance is big in the bank.

[INST] How and why does the exchange rate of a currency change almost everyday? [/INST],"First, you need to understand that economies are dynamic and everchanging. That is, markets themselves drive changes in the underlying economy, based on demand for goods and services, interest in investing, and so forth. Also, people sometimes need to move money between countries, because they own property there and wish to either sell it or use the proceeds elsewhere, people need to pay for purchases from other countries, and more. Money markets are dynamic and everchanging to reflect these changes in the broader global, national, and local economies. Some of it is artificial -- ""hot money"" or ""flight capital"" in markets where money is very insecure, there can be large volumes of people moving money across borders based on their perception of the risk in the local economy, or even based on political conditions. But overall, a strong economy, and one where people understand the basic rules and laws, tends to have a strong currency.  The U.S. is considered one of those countries -- if you look at how much currency is denominated in U.S. dollars, you'll find that it is a very high number. China has a similar proportion of currency denominated in its currency, the Yuan. But in countries where currency volatility and corruption is high, you'll find that people convert to dollars whenever possible.","The simplest explanation is: because people feel like exchanging it. It can be due to a number of reasons including (in no particular order) Political turmoil, interest rate changes, central bank policy, company news, news about the company, government news, etc. The currency markets are very very vast and it is very hard to predict what will have the biggest impact if you don't have access to the data that you need to analyze these situations."
[INST] Are there any statistics that support the need for Title Insurance? [/INST],"Yes, as a matter of fact there are.  Here is an example: Suppose you are buying a home that cost $200,000.  You have a $190,000 30 year fixed mortgage.  You put 20% down and your monthly payment is roughly 1608.00.  But what if your house worth fell drastically in the short term?  What if the actual value is only 70,000 dollars?  If your bank knew this when you applied for the loan then they should have only applied a single lender policy.  This is not what most lenders do now.  Let's apply a policy of $200,000 in the lenders' name to protect the investors and let's see how much our payment would be.  Assuming the average rate for a policy in your area is 0.5 of a percent.  This would increase your 3.99% to 4.0864%, and now the monthly payment is increased by 329 dollars.  What would happen if your monthly payment was 300 dollars more or so?  In some areas they would foreclose.  If you are lucky they will modify your loan and increase your monthly payment 2 years down the road.  For example a bi weekly mortgage for the difference.  Would you be in trouble at that time?  I doubt it.  What would happen if the actual loss was somewhere in the middle?   That would just raise your monthly payment. How likely is this and how often does it happen?  Well if your policy shows the house worth 110,000 now you know you made a bad investment. You can figure the actual mortgage payment with a loan calculator.  For my mortgage it's at least a one thousand dollar increase. If the loan payment had been at the $4000 mark I would find this example more accurate.","Your question reminds me of this passage from chapter 10 of the book called Freakonomics by Stephen D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner. I highly recommend the book if you have the time. The book has examples of the impact that different types of laws have on the economy and human behavior.  The passage that reminded me of your question is the following:  The moral of the story is not the obvious one: You buy title insurance only when it's required,   not when it seems prudent. Rather, it's the often counterintuitive   way to get the most bang for your buck.  The same kind of thinking leads many people to buy a lottery ticket every now and then.  The chance that you'll win the sweepstakes is vanishingly small; if you really wanted to be safe, you would stop playing the lotto.  But it's precisely because you stand such a small chance of getting anything out of your ticket that you buy it -- that's what gives those few of you who do win the lotto such a high return.  For most of you, your winnings will be zero. Like the lottery, buying title insurance isn't a sensible idea if you are a very risk-averse person. To the extent that title insurance does provide protection against some catastrophe, you'd be better off not buying it if you can.  But if you're like most homeowners, it is a very good bet to take. I would not say that I completely agree with the conclusion that the author makes, but it does provide another way to look at the decisions that we make in life. (It should be noted that the author has an economics background, rather than a legal background. The fact that he is recommending something that may be against someone's own self-interest leads me to believe that the conclusion is more than what the author personally would do in such a similar situation.)  This all-in-all makes me want to read the study that the author referred to in the book."

[INST] How do I calculate ownership percentage for shared home ownership? [/INST],"My understanding is that the bank doesn't care how you and your girlfriend divide ownership.  Whatever arrangement you have agreed to. If it was just me then each name on the mortgage should go into the agreement and have exactly equal ownership. We own a home, and have been splitting the mortgage payments and maintenance down the middle, and would like to continue doing so if possible. So, would 50% ownership mean if one person were to stay in the home, and the other was to leave and sell the house, that they would share a 50% ownership in the home, or more likely, 50% of the sale price, depending on amount sold for, but no share in the house? Does it make more sense to divide the bank ownership 70/30, to account for uneven money split by the girlfriend and the other girlfriend, or 50/50 to split the payments down the middle? Well, I would do all the splitting on the monthly payment, but not with regards to how the mortgage is divided between us and the girlfriend.  I want to divide the mortgage 50/50 down the middle between me and the girlfriend, and not her, who was in our lives earlier, just on the payments.  So each person is responsible for their half of the total payments, but splitting things evenly amongst the three of us when it comes to ownership on the house.  If one of us were to move out, they could keep whatever percentage of the mortgage, but not the full amount like they have been doing. Should this work or not, or should both girlfriend's ownership be divided equally (33%, 33%)? You both own an interest in it, but not equal.  The two of you would be getting your money back as well as a percentage of anything above the $150k, to match the girlfriends 20% stake.  If all three of you owned it jointly and equally, then each individual sale would be $220k for an $80k profit.  If you have an interest of $140k, then $40k would go to the other person.  If you owned it 70/30 the payout would be $21k and $7k. I would want to set the monthly payments based solely off of the $70k that I own, not $100k that you do.   You may be thinking that we each contributed the same portion towards the mortage which I will concede, but at the same time, I didn't ask the girlfriend to pay for half a mortgage with me.  I simply stated that I was going to buy a house, and she decided to get ahold of a large portion of it, to the extent that I can't really afford it on my own.  So what I am suggesting is that the mortgage be split 70/30 in our favor.  When we need to do maintenance or repairs, we split it 70/30.  I want to be the person to take care of any home improvements, as I do with my current apartment, and to contribute 70% as opposed to 33%. To put it another way, in the beginning, I had to contribute nothing for my own share in the house (the girlfriend gave me half of her share in terms of money) while currently my girlfriend is contributing a large portion to a mortgage that isn't completely hers. If we were to sell, our girlfriend would receive $40k on the sale.  I want to avoid this kind of stuff as I believe that it creates conflict when one person is essentially contributing more than the other.  What we have said, is that we want to keep the two parts of the mortgage separate from each other and not put them into an agreement.  To me that would be overkill for how we intend to have the whole thing run.","There are a couple of questions here.  First, you have to consider whether you are both planning to continue to pay principal and interest (like a mortgage), or just interest (like rent).  If you plan to both pay principal and interest, should both of you be trying to pay down the principle by a same percentage of your shared interest in the house.  You also do need to consider how much is a contribution, and how much do you owe as payment on the money you have borrowed.  For example, if you start by both paying $500 /month, but one of you puts $10,000 down, and the other puts in $5,000, then your balance sheet will show one member as having a mortgage of $150,000 and the other only $75,000.  Also the mortgage will have a different payment based on interest rates, etc.  I haven't included these numbers in the spreadsheet to keep if simple, but when comparing payments it is easy for everyone to forget one of these things. So, here is a spreadsheet I have prepared using Google Docs Spreadsheets. I have assumed that you both will only pay interest. Also, if you are keeping the monthly payments the same, you will pay down the principal faster, and the amount owed will be different. Here is the spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K8UaJM739gHnIzAJ8xGh8UbPu1Zt6dO1YjY58YlIqrE/edit#gid=808423202 Let me know if it's useful, or if there's anything you don't understand."
[INST] What do I need to be aware of if I choose to resell property early (in Alberta)? [/INST],"As I mentioned in a separate answer, Alberta introduced the Homebuyer Assist Program. This program would appear to allow the sale of a property even before the five years have elapsed. It does appear that they would make a full refund to you, however you would pay the regular interest charges and a fee for the administration of the program.  There might be an argument that the program will have a negative effect as it allows people to pay less attention to the details of your mortgage contract. However I can't think of any negative that is a consequence of the policy. It was suggested in the comments on my original answer that Alberta, Nova Scotia and Ontario have such programs, but I have not reviewed the details of the others.","Be sure to consult with a solicitor who is knowledgeable in real estate matters. You can obtain specific information on the land transfer tax that you may or may not have to pay (and what may count as additional consideration). For the HST, you may qualify for the GST/HST New Residential Construction Rental Property and Resale House Rule (also called the ""rebate rule""), which applies to the purchase or sale of new housing. It allows homebuyers and homebuilders to claim an input tax credit (ITC) on GST/HST they pay on certain residential construction services or housing materials. You also may be able to claim an ITC on GST/HST you paid on certain residential leasing services if you plan to rent the house you newly bought. As a note, the GST/HST New Residential Construction Rental Property and Resale House Rule has no impact when you buy and/or sell non-rental residential property."
[INST] Expiring 401(k) Stock Option and Liquidation Implications [/INST],"It's best to sell that stock right now before it expires in a week, or shortly thereafter, while it's worth something. Then invest it in something less volatile. For example, something like a long-term bond fund or even a ""dividend fund"" that invests in reliable blue-chip companies. As for 401(k), I'd recommend investing it into a low-expense ratio Vanguard S&P 500 ETF such as VOO. However, I'm not sure when Vanguard will be selling the stock. The S&P 500 is a market-index ETF. ETFs follow a large index of the most widely held shares on the market and are the lowest fee way to investing for most situations. (Index funds are essentially mutual-fund versions, but they have a higher expense ratio.) Also for reference: A good rule of thumb among us nerdy types is to have about half your portfolio in bonds or long term investments. The other half in something more likely to go up (I prefer stocks). When you get closer to retirement, then you'll usually want to invest it more into bonds and so on. Then you have less exposure to the market fluctuations.","Your biggest concern for expiring options, in my opinion, should be to realize the gains or avoid the losses.  The most common approach I've used when it comes to expiring options is to do what you can to make them in the money and hopefully realize the gains.  One of the things I do is hold options and a non-option share and use some of the proceeds from selling that share to buy back options.  Theoretically 90% (tax rate) of these gains should be sheltered as long term gains.  If I can make your out at the most, you might consider selling any NSOs you have as well."
[INST] Buying a small amount (e.g. $50) of stock via eToro “Social Trading Network” using a “CFD”? [/INST],"The 'Social Trading Network' is just a feature on the etoro platform which allows traders to share their 'strategy' with other users. So you can see how other users are using their investments. Its not a direct investment into the market and is just giving you a different way to 'research' other traders before investing. The main etoro platform (shares, FX, indices and commodities) uses CFDs in the same way as contracts For Difference. What a CFDs offers is the investor the same returns as if owning physical assets but the main difference is they have no obligation to own the funds used to purchase those assets. Because they use CFD you are technically ""short selling"" the market. eg if you invest $100 using a CFD in BHP and made a 10% return, you will receive the profit of $10. If BHP falls by 10% you will give a return of $10 also. Where as with a physical share or ETF you will gain or lose the complete $100. Also when trading CFDs there is no minimum position size, this can result in large profits or losses being lost so you must be very aware of the risks that is involved when trading with CFDs.","First, the 0.8% spread on ETF's is ridiculous.  A few of the mutual funds have a fee of 2% of the original amount.  The way it works is that you could be paying 4% a year with no gains (and if the investment isn't growing faster than that, you're net losing money!).  Also, you're paying the broker's commissions, so another way of looking at that. Most brokers don't charge on the purchase of stock options, so those are actually pretty good deals, although, some will charge a fee on the expiration date, depending on their policies.  If not, you could be paying $3 - $5 a year for holding an option. Another thing to note with stocks: if they haven't done well, the broker might actually take ownership of the shares and sell them at loss if the stock is tanking. CFD's are used only if there is no other option.  CFD's are an investment by way of an option.  Basically, ""call options"", ""put options"" and ""in the money options"", with the exception that these are in reverse.  You're going to buy a call option that makes money for the other party.  They might be worth it, if you think the company is going out of business.  CFD's are more common than you'd think.  All of the credit default swaps on major organizations, mortgage banks, insurance companies and other financial organizations are actually being paid out in CFD's.  When those investors bought these investments, they basically invested in a call option that would be ""in the money"" if the other party declared bankruptcy or was otherwise in a critical position.  That may be more true for the U.S. vs the rest of the world, because the U.S. government will never allow a major bank to go bankrupt because some rich investors had a change of heart.  If they let a bank go bankrupt in an otherwise stable condition, they'd be setting a precedent that every bank can be allowed to go bankrupt.  That's definitely not the case for companies like IBM or Apple.  Once the government allows a major company like that to go bankrupt, it would set a precedent for them to do so even if it wasn't in a critical situation.  That might send the world economy into a spiral. I hope this helps. Good luck!"
[INST] Is gold really an investment or just a hedge against inflation? [/INST],"In theory, it's an investment; a ""safe haven,"" or at the very least a ""hedge"" against a lot of things. But in reality (depending on how you define reality), it sometimes does quite the opposite, especially compared to the stock market and US treasuries. For example, as the economy goes down, the stock market goes down, because companies are having problems, but people want to buy gold (along with treasuries - gold, like a treasury bond, is seen as a ""risk-free"" buy) and therefore gold prices will go up. So if you have gold, you win in theory, but lose in reality. Then again, if people were all reasonable, and reacted this way to all investments, they'd never have put money in the market, and it would have failed. Reality happens as a result of other people's irrational behavior. I have no opinion whether gold should be in your portfolio, but I don't really think it should be seen as a ""hedge"" unless you specifically identify the risk (i.e. government, or economic collapse, or financial crisis, etc.) that you want to be hedged from. It has risk of its own, namely inflation, which has nothing to do with the stock market (I think?).","Well, gold's value is tied to supply and demand for the chemical element Au (from here) the gold in any given coin, nugget or bar isn't changing, but your definition should include both physical gold and gold bullion (i.e. gold that used to circulate as currency). When people invest in gold ETFs (exchange-traded funds) they don't get a nugget of gold, they're probably buying rights to gold and gold mining company shares. Those are a different animal, they rise with the stock market like any other stock, but are affected by gold as well. These shares aren't the ""real thing"", they're gold as an investment, just as much as a gold ETF."
[INST] Can you explain why these items are considered negatives on my credit report? [/INST],"If you were the landlord receiving the rents, you yourself have no income that is taxable. You still have to report the income as that will influence your tax return, but you don't have to pay taxes on that particular income. So if someone else is the realtor and you receive the rents, that doesn't change your tax situation... you're getting payments for services already rendered. You just have nothing but your own integrity and moral obligation for the payment, if you should default, the IRS will have no way of knowing what it should ask you to pay taxes on, when they come to audit your tax return 6 years down the road. This is just speculation, though, and doesn't take into account many possible mitigating factors, like the other party being responsible for taxes or not having the income, other countries, and so forth. If you were the landlord, the tax situation is more complex as you might be both receiving rental property income you've never paid taxes on (if you're a property that's never been rented before)... and you'll also be giving rental property income that you've never paid taxes on, if the other person in the deal is renting to you... this is going to make a huge difference in what you need to report and what you owe. It sounds like your landlord either doesn't know the tax laws or isn't keeping up with changes as you keep getting these ""investment advice"" letters about things you already knew about the first time.","You gave no information regarding your personal finances so I'm giving general advice. While a hard pull by a company won't affect your score, you still want them to have a good reason to pull your credit.  It's like the old adage, ""dress for the job you want, not the job you have"". Same goes for credit.  Don't go out and apply for credit unless you are pretty certain you'll be approved.  I know you were approved for the mortgage loan, but applying for other credit after being close to maxing out your cards makes the other issuers think you are close to maxing your income. I'm only talking about hard pulls, not soft pulls (like checking to see if you're approved for a loan or a credit card). When someone applies for a loan, one of the first things the lender does is pull the credit report and score. From there they determine your application.  If there's no room for improvement (increase in score, better credit, etc.) then the issuer will deny your application. If you look at the number of times your report was pulled it was 40 times within the last 12 months and 73 altogether.  Considering 2 or less is good, that means that's a lot of companies were wondering if they should lend you money.  If that's not bad your score is suffering and they have a good reason to deny your application."
[INST] Will an ETF immediately reflect a reconstitution of underlying index [/INST],"It means that the ETF has not yet been rebalanced, so there's not yet updated weighting of the individual components of the underlying index. It means that it still currently reflects the weighting of the index as of the re-weighting announcement date, but may very well diverge from that in the near-term.","No you can't just look at the change of an ETF and the change of its benchmark and draw a single conclusion.  First off, the price of an ETF  reflects the price of the underlying holdings, which may or may not be at market value at any given moment.  Suppose you had a single stock ETF with 10,000 shares outstanding and at 9:30 am the shares traded at $10.  At 9:31 you just got news that a competitor declared bankruptcy.  This should cause the stock to crash, but because it's 9:31 am and the market is closed it won't.  However this will cause the share price to drop at 10 when the market opens and the change in price of an ETF can be impacted by this.  It may seem small, but when you have an ETF with thousands of holdings it can be large enough to dwarf the news behind the reason for the change in index composition. Also to the comment that the index will go out of whack, they won't.  Most ETFs I know of have a process for adding and removing holdings.  The reason people complain most with the rebalancing of ETFs is they think that its like when a stock splits, where if they get 4 shares instead of 1 their shares will have to be cut in half.  That's not how it works in the ETF.  In the ETF there is a process where new shares are distributed to owners who want to buy shares (those will be 20% larger than the original shares, where as shares can be as small as 1/1000)  and those who are taking profit give up their shares into an auction where those who want to buy give up 20% less the original share.  Now you may get a smaller share for the share you are giving up, but you are getting more shares for every share you are giving up so even if you give up 10 shares you will still have more than you had originally.  This is why the number of shares are a very dynamic number and its impossible to draw conclusions from any point in time. You can see the change in composition here: http://www.indexfundadvisor.com/etf_comparison/0feb8ee935328f8ce85c1cdf7cfe074c/0dcd5caf1c90718f2324ce75c1f3bc94. The fund you are taking about is the iShares Russell 1000 growth ETF.  If you look at historical trades there you can see that 10 years ago the same composition held but at the time the fund had a much lower dollar value than it does now.  So if you look at the 10 year index, I think you'll see that it went down because of the composition and less directly to the impact of the current rebalance.  However if you look at its current value you will notice that this index has gone up in value."
[INST] What does the Fed do with the extra money it is printing? [/INST],"What does the Fed do with the extra money it is printing? Do they print it on paper? Or do they simply put it in a digital bank account? I have never seen anyone explain how they do this... or at least I never believed the explanation, assuming they were printing paper money. It is possible that the US government is borrowing money from the public (or not paying back what they owe through QE, TARP, etc.), and the Fed is using that to exchange for foreign currencies. The US has the potential to hold massive amounts of foreign currency without going into debt, yet the dollar/euro are both weakening... so in essence, the US is actually gaining foreign currency and decreasing it's debt.","The Federal Reserve has three primary responsibilities and tools. When the Federal Reserve needs to influence the economy, it uses one of its three tools —open market operations, changing the discount rate and, if necessary, raising or lowering the reserve requirement (i.e., the ratio of a bank's deposits and other non-federal reserve securities to its liabilities). These tools are at the banks' disposal.  The Federal Reserve can create money in the form of Federal Reserve Notes or Federal Reserve Deposits. Federal Reserve notes, are issued to Federal Reserve Banks by the Department of the Treasury. Money is often printed and distributed in currency that belongs to each of us equally. When new money is printed and enters the flow of money, inflation usually follows. (Inflation is a general rise in prices level over a period of time) Inflation is the increase in demand but decreased supply. This is most often the result of excessive money creation.  Inflation will likely result from the printing of money or the devaluation of the dollar (foreign exchange markets will sell dollars for other currencies).  The Federal reserve then, has to decide where it wants to invest this money that was printed. They can hold it in vaults, buy gold or invest it in other countries. The Federal Reserve Banks can make purchases or sales of securities directly for their own accounts or for the accounts of depository institutions. These transactions in marketable securities are known as open market operations. These transactions change the condition of bank reserves in the economy by directly affecting bank deposits and other liabilities.  In addition, the Federal Reserve Banks may buy or sell balances between themselves by borrowing or lending Federal Reserve notes, or currency, to and from other banks. The changes in reserves resulting from such transactions are the principal source of changes in the size of a bank's deposit and other loanable funds; as well as the price of currency and the amount of currency that is circulated in the economy."
[INST] Are solar cell panels and wind mills worth the money? [/INST],"I think your question is: should I invest in some big system that I can use to power my home and sell excess energy back to the power company, or should I purchase individual devices to replace existing home technology and reduce my reliance on grid power? I am sure others will offer suggestions on how to calculate potential payback if you are interested in that approach. But personally, I would focus less on the economics, and more on the environmental benefits.","The cost of power varies widely depending on where you live. Your electric bill may run $30/month, but that's not what power costs in the coal country of Wyoming. In California it may run $200/month. In Oregon, about half that. Costs may go up for you, but are likely to get cheaper as more solar panels come out. Also, some utilities will pay you to put solar panels on roofs so as to take you off the grid. This, in my opinion, is the biggest hurdle to ""going green"". Until more utilities offer this service, the only choice is to sell your excess or use it yourself."
[INST] Why do 10 year-old luxury cars lose so much value? [/INST],"Larger purchase prices, faster depreciation rate, and luxury maintenance and parts costs tend to be major culprits in high value depreciation. Other factors such as brand prestige, age, and availability of used units factor in as well though.  For example (just using numbers from the US market): For these cars, the higher depreciation curve is mainly due to the original MSRP being higher on average, but some other factors are at play here; for example, in addition to the higher original purchase price mentioned above, some other factors have been identified here, and are applicable to luxury cars. Also see this and this (although that latter link is for Canada, but I suspect it's pretty similar in the US). For these cars, it's hard to identify individual components that are affecting depreciation so much - the biggest factor here seems to be the brand and its perceived prestige (and the relative availability of used cars in the market), which will obviously affect the second-hand market price.","I will address the financial value of the vehicle to the owner; because that is the value that you're most likely interested in. You could consider a vehicle that you drive to be a type of stock (with dividends that take the form of transportation). The price (p) of a vehicle can depend on both the age (a) and value (v) of the vehicle according to some simple function p(a,v) where high values for v correspond to good value. Note that just because your mileage is low, does not mean that the value is high (v=100) or vice versa (v=0). Your initial value is high (v=50) when it is new. As the value falls slowly, the price also begins to fall, as a result of normal wear that most vehicles experience. However, the more an individual is a ""driver of a luxury vehicle"", as opposed to a ""driver of the car"", the higher that the price remains with aging. In that case, the price will follow the form p(a,v) which is roughly as follows: In this function, the price falls very quickly at very beginning, then settles into an exponential decay. If you drive a luxury car, at age 20 the price drop will be much smaller than if you drive a normal car. However, as the price drops, people will start to notice. The price will begin to drop in popularity (s=price/number of views) and will quickly move down an exponential curve: Finally, your vehicle will become like a normal car, and the remaining price is determined simply by mileage. Because your luxury car becomes more and more like a normal car, the rate of the exponential curve will increase, until it reaches the point where the mileage starts to matter. (Note that in order for an aging car to still be worth $100 000, an individual has to both like that specific car brand and drive the car very carefully). I would argue that for the vast majority of people, luxury cars don't start to lose significant value until about 5-10 years after their purchase. In this period of time the price falls at only a modest rate. This can be an ideal time to cash in some of the excess returns on this vehicle. After such a period of time the price usually starts to drop more quickly during the next several years and your vehicle will likely be worth less than half of its original price. This is typically where you enter the realm of ""buyers remorse"" (which is why people tend to get rid of their vehicles after this period). Thereafter, the value continues to fall. When it drops to about 15% the price, the price will drop very quickly. This is because your vehicle will drop out of the realm of what the majority of people consider to be ""recently traded"", and will be considered to be an old beat. The rate at which the price drops will increase during this final period as you approach the lower limit of a vehicle that a dealer will buy from you (v = 10%). So, we answer the question of 'why do 10 year-old luxury cars lose so much value' by simply saying, because they get more and more like a normal car. In order to get a luxury price later on requires a lot of careful driving and maintaining of the vehicle. People that have that mentality are not typical ones as there are many more people that consider that the car is their money maker, i.e. by reselling the car for more value so that they can buy even more luxury cars. This results in them devaluing the vehicle to sell it off to recoup lost value in a short period of time. Note this model ignores the financial returns of driving luxury vehicles which may add significantly to the value for other individuals (in which case the value will likely be higher)."
[INST] How is a stop order price different from an ask price [/INST],"A stop order is an instruction to the broker as to what to do when the market price changes in a particular way.  The stop order price is the minimum price you are willing to accept.  Stop orders can be used to limit losses or to protect profits. So, if you buy some stock and then you later decide you don't want it anymore, you may want to sell your stock but only at a particular price such as 105.  You can do this through a stop order.  This is also sometimes referred to as your mental stop.  A stop loss order is another example of a stop order. Your mental stop price is what you are willing to accept so that you do not take any further losses.  You may not want to get out of the stock completely after you have lost money.  Instead, you might just want to reduce your losses if the price increases.  Therefore, a stop loss may not be equal to the lowest selling price in the market (the ask price).  It may be above the ask price. Your stop price may be the same as another order in the market and this creates an opportunity for this order to be hit by the highest buy order.  This is especially beneficial for a buy stop order because it can have the same effect as a stop market order and buy a stock at a higher price.  It doesn't always work this way though.  It depends on the order and it is difficult to predict how many other buyers or sellers there are behind where you are buying. For a stop sale order, this may be the first place the seller will sell, even if more sell orders are available below your stop price.","This is very related to another question I asked once before: Where can I find a live order book for the NYSE / NASDAQ in realtime for free? There is no such thing. Orders are not executed at the ask or the bid. They are matched with other orders. When your order meets another that exceeds your limit, you are filled partially or entirely, and the fills are recorded in the order book. The difference between the ask and the limit on your order will be called the slippage or commission, or some other similar terminology."
[INST] Payroll reimbursments [/INST],"You don't pay taxes on reimbursements, because you've already paid taxes, first, on the gross income you use to pay the costs out of pocket.  You pay taxes on income, not expenditures. If you are reimbursed the exact dollar amount of your expense then you should have zero taxable income.  The employer cannot deduct the cost because you're going to pay taxes on the wages paid regardless.  This is the basis of the concept of double taxation. The IRS treats you as having been reimbursed, by increasing your income with the amount of the expenditure, in the same year you made the expenditure. Therefore, if you spent $500 in October but have only been reimbursed for $200 since then, you cannot claim a deduction for the remaining $300 until next year because the $300 is considered taxable 2016  income.  If, instead, they had reimbursed you for $300 this past October, you could have filed an amended tax return in 2015 showing your income as $50 lower while increasing your taxable deductions by $500.  This would increase the amount of tax return you received from having paid less in taxes and having more in deductions.  Thus, next year your income will be a little higher than this year, but your taxes will be less.  But this isn't possible now because the reimbursement and deduction didn't occur the same year.  You can, however, save some money if you file an amended tax return from 2015 increasing your taxable income by the $200 they already paid you while increasing your deduction by the same amount. Then your taxes in 2016 will be a little lower while in this year you'll pay a little more in taxes...","Reimbusrsment of employee expense, which in your case - travel expenses is a different type of income, which will be taxed differently. A different rate, different withholding status, different pay period, etc. It's all in the IRS publication 15-B. Section 13. Deductible and Nondeductible Business Expenses gives an example where travel reimbursment is deductible, if it meets reasonable business standard: If an employer reimburses an employee for travel expenses, the reimbursed   amounts are subject to withholding tax and payroll tax if they are not   deductible expenses to the employer under section 262. If you are an employee,   you report amounts received as pay in box 12 of your Form W-2, and your employer   reports the amount as wages in box 1, including state wage tax on amounts   in box 12. Note: If an employer reimburses an employee for travel expenses,   the reimbursed amounts are considered payroll employment income unless   they meet the requirements of the IRS revenue procedure. Contact your local   IRS office for information on determining whether the reimbursed expenses   meet the IRS revenue procedure requirements."
[INST] Should I fund retirement with a static asset allocation or an age based glide path? [/INST],"I've added this as comment to D Stanley's answer as I don't have the rep to comment directly.  In general, there are three categories of retirement planners: those who use the 4% safe withdrawal rate; those who use the 10% and 20% safe withdrawal rate for the first year, and then progressively decrease the amount taken later year by year (and adjust by inflation for the amount taken); and those who create your own retirement plan by taking the total of what you need in retirement and subtract from that what your investments are expected to provide, and then plan for the difference. There are other categories as well, such as those who advocate drawing down on principal in some fashion, but those are the main categories.  As for the answer to your question, when you look at the safe withdrawal rate based strategies, one is based on the 4%, and those based on 10% and 20% both are more complex.  So you need to decide how complex you want your situation to be when you decide what percentage you allocate.  I would suggest that since a 4% safe withdrawal rate has been demonstrated to likely support you through your retirement at the rate of inflation, that is the most popular of the strategies.  You should take an aggressive portion of your portfolio and put it in safe investments that are likely to earn the inflation rate or more until you retire.  Then, when you are in your fifties, start slowly reducing your risk and increasing liquidity.  Then start your withdrawals for your specific purpose and adjust your risk/liquidity levels and withdrawals appropriately.","You are young and starting a 401(k) is great!  You have options on how to pick the funds and I'm going to assume, for the sake of discussion, that the glide path is the one recommended by the plan administrators. First you need to decide if your employer will match your contributions.  Don't leave free money on the table!  I would recommend that you max out your employee match before doing anything else. Next you should decide how you want your retirement investment broken up.  Do you want 100% equity, 100% bond, or somewhere in between.  (I would recommend the equity / bond allocation according to your investment risk.)  You will need to decide if you will want additional shares of an equity ETF, bond ETF, or money market fund in your 401(k) account. Remember, to get the company match, contributions need to be made at least monthly.  While putting aside some of each paycheck, your asset allocation will be changing monthly as contributions will be added to either the equity funds or the bond funds.  If the plan administrator's glide path is based, for example, on the Vanguard Target Retirement Fund, there might be issues.  If the fund has no other shares in your account (or too few shares), you might not be able to rebalance since the fees would be too high to liquidate enough shares to balance the portfolio.  I don't know if the 401(k) plan allows you to buy equity ETF shares to rebalance.  You might need to contact the 401(k) plan administrator. If you choose the glide path, I would recommend buying additional shares of the appropriate glide path ETF or mutual fund in a tax efficient account. Don't forget to open a Roth IRA if you have a tax liability to help offset the Roth tax liability.  The Roth IRA may allow better tax treatment as well as more diversification.  This could help with balancing and re-balancing.  While you will not be able to put more money into a Roth past the IRS maximums, you always have the option to convert it to a Traditional IRA to take advantage of the tax treatment for additional contributions (like this year with the 2011 Saver's Credit for Roth IRA's.) If the fees for the glide path funds are exorbitant, you might want to ask the 401(k) administrators if they would allow you direct investment into an equity ETF and/or a bond ETF at little cost to the 401(k) plan."
[INST] Definition of gross income (Arizona state tax filing requirements) [/INST],"This question should probably be closed as a duplicate because of the ""tax filing requirements"" part. But since the current accepted answer to that post doesn't answer your question specifically, here's a new answer: Note: The Arizona tax filing requirements only consider AGI but specifically state that you need to include all your tax sources! So I do need to provide all of my income sources? Yes. You should include all of your income when figuring out your AGI. How do I determine what is tax rate I will be in? Why do some sources online say to just include wages? Is this all done by using this Arizona Tax form? Arizona tax law is simple: https://azstatetax.gov/tax-and-information/az-income-tax/rulings-and-faqs/pdf/individual.pdf. The last point of interest is: If you were not required to file due to Arizona AGI requirements, then you file Form 140-W, 141-W or 143-W to report taxes on any gross income. So, either file the return or explain why you don't have to file any taxes.","I'm going to hazard a guess that your wife's income is the issue here.  As mentioned in the other answers, Arizona tax law requires certain types of income to be reported on the tax returns, but the income cut-offs are per person, regardless of dependents. The threshold is quite low, I saw it quoted at $9,000 in my research.   This means that the cut-off is more a matter of how much money you make collectively, rather than an amount per person. It's not a matter of income of individuals, but of combined (married filing jointly) income. Also, some income is exempted from taxation, which will offset this somewhat, such as some disability payments and VA tax exemptions, but not all disability payments and exemptions are equal. The exemption only applies to the exemption amount in state tax law, not to income tax at the Federal level."
[INST] Buying my first car out of college [/INST],"The big difference between ""lease"" and ""purchase"" is that with a lease, your monthly costs are lower, in exchange for some restrictions. In this case, you can avoid a negative-option lease which tries to make lease extension seem ""inevitable"" by getting what they call a ""cap-fee lease."" This means that if you go out of lease early, you need to pay only the depreciation from when you bought the car to the end of the lease. If you return it on time, there are no other fees. Since you will probably have lower savings in the 3 years after you finish college than you have now, this also will probably mean a monthly payment less than what you are currently paying. If you know what other options you have, then you can assess this. The question will be whether the lease makes sense after considering your current lease situation, whether the lease will actually be cheaper than your current lease when everything is factored in, and whether you will use the car for the time left on your existing lease.","If the car seems reliable in your testing, buying the car outright and getting financing through a bank that doesn't charge a lot of fees can be smarter than financing through the dealership. They'll have a deal to give you that is good to them, not always good for you like it looks. If you negotiate a deal with the dealership and then go shopping for your own financing you could get a better rate that way than buying what the dealership is selling."
[INST] Can I buy a new house before selling my current house? [/INST],"Yes. It's actually a good thing to do, for a couple reasons: You can't know what the exact timing of house sales will be.  You can make an educated guess, of course, but there is some amount of random on the table of which you're the agent. You'll probably want an inspection (unless you have reason to believe it's clean), and that takes time - time, of course, that you don't have at this point. You can be sure of when you get the money from the sale of your current house (you know when escrow closes), so if you find a house you really like, you can know exactly when you can buy it.  That gives you a better negotiating position when buying the new house, and it can make you look less flaky, if you go into the negotiation with a firm offer. The money you get from the sale might get you a better deal in buying a house.  You may not get a big amount, but if you can sell your home for $300,000 instead of $280,000 you can use that $20,000 to bid higher on a property you like. This will be most important if you are financing, but it can help with cash purchases too.  You can increase the size of your down payment, which may make you more competitive when placing an offer. Finally, and more importantly, it makes moving easier.  You're not stressing about the sale, or trying to get it done on a time table the buyer has in mind.  You're doing what you need to get done.  When you move, you move when you're done with the new house prep.","You said you wanted to find out if you can do what you want to do.  We are trying to give you as much information as we can in both the answers above but here are a few more points just to give you more information to go on: If you're talking about taking out the second mortgage while you sell the home for the downpayment; banks will not finance the 2nd mortgage at the same rate they will finance the 1st.  The reason being is you already have a 1st to pay off.   If it is all the money you have, and you can't come up with the downpayment for the 2nd you have to make a choice between the debt burden (car payoff and 2nd mortgage vs. debt burden 1st mortgage + a higher debt burden for the car payoff + any savings you might have)  The 10% payment you already have to give to your brother/sister-in-law is the down payment for your house.  You cannot use it for any other purpose, this is the law. You can refinance the car, but if you are doing that to get the payment lower, you want to re-negotiate the price/trade in agreement, or you are getting extra money, and still can't make the payment;  I would seriously consider getting rid of the car, and saving at least some money for the 2nd mortgage.  If you keep the car it is very much possible with both payments you will be paying more a month then you currently are. One thing that does not get brought up in answer that really surprised us was your payment on your current house.  You said your payment is currently $430 a month.  That is a very small payment.  Even if your monthly income has gone down, and your interest is very high; the banks still expect you to pay an extra 10% payment a month in addition to your mortgage payment when you go through an arrears loan.  Also when you are already behind, you should be giving to extra payment to your monthly mortgage to try to get ""Back on track""  If you are not; you are really putting you finances in a bad situation, and are asking for trouble.  I hope you can get caught up."
[INST] I'm 23 and was given $50k. What should I do? [/INST],"First of all, do not invest this money in the stock market at this age, or anything but the safest investments. If you need the money for tuition, house money, something like that in the next 2 years or so, you should park this money in a money market fund or savings account. You can get upwards of $1.15 dollars per month in interest. I get 2.92% APY on USAA and I believe AMEX also has a high rate. The only difference is that you can't lose money in the short-term, but you'll probably also find it difficult to make money on it in the short-term, either.  There are plenty of examples of money market funds available, but in your situation where you need money immediately because you're out of your other (credit card) loan funds I would probably use the lowest-fee IRA. You will pay $9.25 if you start an IRA with Vanguard but only 65$ with the sharebuilder IRA. I would consider the sharebuilder option. It will save you money just to get yourself out of the short-term loan mess you're in.","I would invest $30k in a no-load/no-fee S&P 500 index fund, and keep the remaining money deposited or in cash.  Do not invest in bonds, and do not invest in dividend index funds."
[INST] How to prevent myself from buying things I don't want [/INST],"It's about discipline, plain and simple.  The money you could be using for a better future needs to have a better use than a new toy or other trinket that's ""cool"". My advice is to make sure you understand your goals:  To what extent do you wish to save money vs live a fun and fulfilling life while being a saver?  If you have some basic goals: to have a certain amount of money by some age (and thus have the ability to be debt free and invest in additional assets), or to some degree of security (I don't know what my number is). I have one of those goals, and a lot of people don't. If your goal is, for example, a specific number of $ saved by retirement age (or, like me, by age 33), then simply follow the 50% rule: If you spend less than 50% of your income, your spending is below the average. This means that 50% or more of every paycheck should go into savings/paying off debt. (Or, as was my goal at 28, have 8x what I need for retirement by that age). This is a very conservative rule and will allow nearly anyone to put away more money. There are other techniques, but I like this one as it's very simple.  Once you're saving more, it becomes easy to do.  (Note: the 50% rule excludes basic housing, if you need $750/month to live, then the 50% rule is simply to spend less than $5000/mo).  A good number of people spend $6500 on housing and car payments alone, making it even easier to save a lot of their income.","The reason you are finding it hard to cut out spending is because you are not being thorough. In the back of your mind you are still entertaining the idea of buying the stuff, therefore you will always find a way to rationalize spending your money. You need to get rid of the idea that you can buy the things that you want by being more frugal or cutting out ""bogus spending""  (as this is just allowing yourself to buy your big expenses with savings or ""free"" money made from couponing). You have said you are good at budgeting, so set 6 budgeting objectives: You need to be 100% honest with yourself about how to spend your money. You can not say that you want to use part of your budget on ""extras"" (see how vague ""extras"" is). This is not working for you, and if it was, you would have already achieved your goal. You need to be specific so that you know in advance whether the purchase will be in your budget or outside your budget. It is also time to get back to your roots. The reason you have no credit card debt is because you are very good at budgeting. You also said you are frugal. It sounds like you have always been careful to buy things that are needed and not wanted. Just remember how it felt the last time you were debt free and in control of your spending. It really is a good feeling. Go back to the way you always were, and the budget will look after itself."
"[INST] Pay off credit cards in one lump sum, or spread over a few months? [/INST]","The correct answer is it depends. You would want to prioritize paying down your credit cards with the highest interest rates first. I'd do that if I were you. Why? You'll minimize your APR's and get your payment down sooner and probably the most painless. Then you can worry about the next card with the next-lowest rate, etc. I like this guy's answer.","I think you should pay it off in full right away.  You mentioned that the 0% interest deal was over.  Are you getting any rewards from the card? If you are, then it is probably not to your advantage to pay off the card. If there is no reward and you have the cash in the bank, paying it back in the shortest amount of time will likely mean you get a credit increase if you ever happen to need it.  It may also help your credit rating with other credit agencies even if the bank doesn't report it.  In fact, according to your post, it might actually be hurting your credit rating with those credit agencies because you only have $8-9k on a card with a credit limit of 25k.  In my opinion that's not going to be doing you any favors. As far as the effect on your credit rating with the card company: what did you pay the $8k on?  Are you going to buy groceries for the next two years with credit to earn them the 1% back? Credit score agencies are pretty much out to get everyone.  They'll take every credit hit and reward that exists... and for the most part, you'll never see them.  If it is your intention to have a 0% interest rate for a limited time, do it.  If you're paying off a credit card balance of $8k with $6k to go, and now you're starting with $0, then you just lost 3-6 months of any 0% interest that your card might have given you in that time period."
[INST] Why is retirement planning so commonly recommended? [/INST],"The whole premise of your question - that investing for retirement is a waste of effort unless one has savings - is incorrect. Even the most simple investment strategy takes advantage of compound interest to grow an investment amount.  Even if you didn't contribute anything to the account, you'd still get something from market fluctuations.  If you were to start with nothing, and invest in an account that averaged 8% interest, after 25 years you'd have nearly $100,000 (assuming you could avoid withdrawing anything from the account). If you add $300 a month to that account, after 25 years you'd have more than $550,000.  By 50 years, that would be up to $2.8 million with $300 a month contributions. Even a modest, hands-off investment can yield very significant results if it's invested over a long period of time. That assumes you invest before the age of 30 - at that time the compound interest is far higher, and yields better returns. The longer you wait to invest, the less of an impact that time can have. Of course, the earlier you invest, the more options you have for retirement funds.  You can change your allocations as you get closer to retirement, with less time for the money to grow.  You may have more conservative or stable funds the closer you get, and less of any money tied up in high-risk ventures. Even investing for retirement and saving that money for another event or purpose is still a good idea, because no matter how long or short your investment period is, it can still reap great benefits for you in the future. The best part of investing for retirement is that money is yours whether you live to 80 and cash out, use it in an emergency, or die prematurely and leave it to your heirs.","As you point out, the primary reason it is recommended or required is that when you stop working the income from your retirement assets may have to pay for your ongoing living expenses.   You have to plan for the future so that your income from your retirement accounts (IRA, pensions, etc) can pay for your expenses.  Many of these accounts can be invested in the stock market and they are subject to the 40% income tax as well as a 10% penalty if they are withdrawn prior to your 59½ birthday.   The retirement planners and financial advisers recommend saving money in tax deferred accounts while also saving money outside of these tax deferred accounts.  Saving outside of these retirement accounts will allow you to have assets that are not subject to penalties.  With today's high income taxes and higher potential tax rates in the near to mid term future, tax deferred savings are not the best approach to retirement savings.  A retirement plan can also include other resources such as part time employment as well as additional income from business activities.   Retirement is a phase in peoples' lives and a new phase has many aspects.  It requires that you prepare for a change of employment as well as the reduction of or elimination of the retirement benefits provided to employees."
"[INST] If throwing good money after bad is generally a bad idea, is throwing more money after good Ok? [/INST]","To add to the comments above, sometimes investing more in a failing position can become a way of life for a person, even if the investment has little chance of ever being profitable. This can happen more easily if there is a person or people behind the failing business, like a family, who have a vested interest in its survival.  This can make a person ignore the reality in front of him and keep investing regardless of the losses. This might become a way of life, and people might not even perceive it as abnormal.  It can be hard to tell the difference between this and a case where a person might have other reasons to believe the situation will turn out alright. The person might refuse to admit the truth, whether the truth is the business will never earn back all the investment, or the truth that the business will have success.  But a person who refuses to admit the truth of a failure will keep investing, no matter how often he is warned not to.  If it gets bad enough, such a person might be a prime candidate for an intervention, but they're far from it in the beginning.","The original question was based on the old saying of never throwing good money away after bad.  I think there's a misconception because the term is used in two ways.  There's the old saying of not throwing good money after bad. That's just a colloquial way of saying you can't dig yourselves out by digging more.  However, the term is also used to caution against pouring more money into a lost investment.  You may decide that the investment didn't pan out, but that investing in that one market segment is still a good idea.  In this sense, it might be possible to get value out of putting good money behind some bad choices.  It really depends on the circumstances."
[INST] Debit cards as bad as credit cards? [/INST],"Credit cards are bad from a financial standpoint and have ruined people's lives and relationships, but debit cards, in my opinion, are way worse.  The main problem is that money is taken directly from your bank account, not just from a creditor in a ""later payment"" manner.  However, in that regard, if you are disciplined about it, you could use your debit card wisely, but people with discipline would never use an irresponsible debit card in the first place.  Another issue is that a credit card offers some protection against fraud.  With a debit card, the bank has already taken your money and the business or person who was robbed may never get it back.  If you have money automatically being deposited in your account via your job, then that money will be used up, and without it your checking account may quickly go negative.  With a credit card, the bank is taking your money later (it's still money you are responsible for and eventually will have to pay back regardless, but the bank has still given you more than the normal credit grace period on when you have to pay it back).  Again, if you are going to be buying things on a debit card, then discipline is important.  Make sure you only buy things you need.  One of the problems with credit cards is that people tend to try to buy things they don't need that they can't truly afford anyway.  A debit card is less likely to be used this way because there are immediate financial consequences.  On the other hand, a debit card isn't going to help you, for example, build credit rating.  In the United States, that credit rating is the new currency.  Without one, you are severely limited.  So using debit cards will limit your ability to use credit cards in the future.  On the other hand, it may be a small price to pay to stay out of financial trouble.  Ultimately the decision to use a debit card is a lifestyle decision.  Credit cards encourage a lifestyle of fringe spending.  If you can't use a credit card for such a lifestyle, then you probably shouldn't use a debit card for it, and use a debit card for only the purchases you really need anyway.","I was of the opinion debit cards have no purpose other than the ability to spend the money you have.  A friend of a friend tried to explain to me why debit cards were necessary, but I don't think I need a debit card until the last dollar has gone into the bank.  I just feel this is part of a conspiracy with the banks to keep more of the money in them.  In my opinion, debit cards should be reserved for people who can not be responsible enough to pay their credit cards off. The fact that your payroll was cut off at the source tells me your identity was compromised.   If you want access to your money faster and it helps the payroll issue, then perhaps a credit union or your bank would be willing to create a line of credit based on your credit history."
[INST] How do you declare an interest free loan? [/INST],"Your questions seems to be a little muddled between loan and equity. The ""equity"" you received does not have to be repaid, so it's not really a loan. So, I suppose you could say you took an interest free loan. In your case the ""interest free loan amount"" (equity) was $20,000, that was ""loaned"" as a ""down payment"". So, if this is the case, I think I would state it is an interest free loan. But when it comes to the accounting, it depends on your chart of accounts. How did you get the $20,000 of new equity and how did it ""get"" into your owner's equity account? Did you put in $20,000 (to represent the equity) or did you use your owner's equity to pay $20,000 for either cash or the mortgage (a liability). So, let's go over it: You bought it for $20,000, with $4,000 to bring to the settlement. You made a deal to borrow the $16,000 and put in $20,000 (2.5%) for the down payment. Now, here are 3 ways it should be entered: 1) You put $20,000 into your owner's equity and the rest of the $16,000 you paid for the cash. I do not see how you would account for the money you put in, i.e.- it would not show up in the liabilities and would represent you paying cash. 2) You put the $20,000 into your owner's equity and paid the cash down payment. Next, you pay the $16,000 to the ""equity loan"" in the mortgage payable account or by using the ""equity"" cash of $20,000 and pay $4,000 cash. 3) I'm not sure what you would do here, other than put both payments into the mortgage payable account and put 2.5% in the equity account. If you put in $20,000 (representing that you have put in 2.5%) and you have a cash balance, then your cash balance would represent the original $20,000 down payment. If you put an actual cash of $20,000 as the down payment, when it comes to your owner's equity calculations later, you'll need to add back both the $20,000 and the $20,000 ""equity"", unless you have taken money out of the owner's equity (which you did not do in the process of buying the house). So, it seems that a proper accounting for this should be as follows (the process you described): It's important to mention that I don't think the accounting should represent ""You bought it for $20,000 (2.5%) ..."", I think the entry should be ""You borrowed $16,000, used a 2.5% of the $20,000 sale price as a down payment, and put the $20,000 as your equity in the home"". I don't think the entry needs to reflect how much of what you paid for the house was put towards the down payment and it doesn't seem that it should to represent it like you've paid more of a down payment than you really did. It should be how much you borrowed from your equity (loan), using a 2.5% down payment (equity), and the $16,000 loan for an $18,500 purchase price (money borrowed - cash).","I think it would be more accurate to say ""What's the right way to declare an $x principal loan for which payments are made in $y increments with $z interest paid periodically?"" The question of what's right depends on what you have previously entered into the accounting system.  A principle of accounting is ""Substance over form"", which is really an attempt to get at whether it really makes a difference whether you call something a loan or something else.  It makes a small amount of difference as far as accounting rules and regulations are concerned, but once you consider what the accounting is actually reporting on, it really doesn't  matter. Once something is in the system, the system will do what it's told.  So if you go to your chart of accounts and enter an account named ""1500-Interest revenue"", then you'll have to use that account for anything related to interest payments.  If that  account is closed, then any interest income will have to go to another unrestricted/un-closed revenue account. The general entry for anything related to interest income or expense is (you should consult your specific chart of accounts to be sure that the account numbers and names are correct): Income AccR Int1500-Interest revenue                                                1 Depreciation/Int AccR 0000-Interest expense                                                                     1  Any time you have depreciation or amortization that is tied to an interest payment, you must treat it that way in the accounting or it will throw all kinds of financial ratios and other measurements out of kilter. You could also do this: Expense Int1500- Interest expense                                                  1 Rec Income 0000-Interest income                                                                     1 For interest expense, this isn't right, but in many non-profit accounting applications the expense account isn't always closed. If the chart of accounts closes the Interest Expense account and reopens it as Interest Income, you could probably get away with this: Expense Int1500- Interest expense                                                                    1 Depreciation/Int AccR 0000-Interest expense                                                                  1 Rec Income Int1500- Interest income                                                                                1 And so on and so forth. If you create a new account that is not on your chart of accounts, you probably don't need a closing entry, although it's a good idea as part of end of year or month closing routines.  If you try to do so and you get an error message, consult your chart of accounts or ask your financial person what to do; you'll need to do something to have those revenues accounted for, so even though it will get out of your way temporarily, it still has to get dealt with. You could also simply treat the principle payments as principal repayments, rather than as additional interest payments.  If you paid $6 to close principal and then another $6 is paid as Interest Accrued, the accounting will simply reflect that you've paid $11 against $6 principal.  That's the way to start, but after that there's no way to tell that any of the amount has been paid in principal.  If you pay $10, is it all principal or the first half of the next payment and a little extra for principal?  You need to have a record of the interest that's been paid. But that's all theory. In practice, accounting needs to reflect your business, which should reflect substance rather than form. If someone is willing to loan you an amount of money and pay it off in installments, then there's an agreement and no further adjustments need to be made after the terms of your agreement are met.  Your chart of accounts needs only to show that the money has been deposited, and that it is being paid against principal and interest.  If that is not sufficient, you either need to talk to the other person about changing the terms of the transaction, which means making a new accounting entry, or you need to change the accounting system to accommodate the details of the agreement between the two parties. Either way, the accounting changes. It's really not about principle payments per se, but simply that whatever you've agreed to, this time all of your payments are for a single agreement.  For example, you buy gas on your card to make a trip in your car.  It's not really all principal and some interest, but the accounting for that transaction isn't going to reflect the transaction in any detail other than that you've paid against that one specific obligation."
[INST] Is 6% too high to trade stocks on margin? [/INST],"Risk is a function of price volatility and margin of equity needed.  Price volatility is primarily a market risk; you might need to diversify (by market cap and other variables) if they are highly correlated.  Margin of equity is primarily a function of leverage.  A well-informed investor will have a better understanding of how to minimize this risk (of course the market doesn't always work they way we'd expect).  This risk should include an estimate of the probability distribution of returns. For a diversified portfolio, the risk will probably be relatively limited.  I don't know if you can really determine it or not without knowing the rest of the portfolio.  (I've given an outline of one way to consider the risk, but it's likely far too complex for what you were trying to do.) On the other hand, it sounds like you're looking into this now because you're concerned about possible losses.  Unfortunately, it's not really possible to predict when potential losses will become actual losses (or even if losses will occur at all).  One person might say ""you can't take a loss until you sell the underlying"" (which is the current value) and another might say ""a loss happens only when you're buying the current value"" (which is the cost basis).","The biggest thing to take away from any margin experience (good or bad) is that margin trading will result in you selling out if a position moves against you. There are many stories of hedge funds being down 30%, with only 70% margin and ending up losing 99% of their capital after the stock falls below the required level. Margin can be a great tool, but you need to use caution in using it, and you don't want to let your emotions cloud your judgement. If you're on the wrong side of a trade, just get out and take whatever loss. Don't hold on to the position to earn back your position."
[INST] When will the U.K. convert to the Euro as an official currency? [/INST],"The United Kingdom joined the EU in 1973, so the history of Britain and the euro has been closely intertwined. The United Kingdom was not on the euro's list of potential members. This was mainly because of the fact that the UK economy was bigger than all of the countries in the region, so a currency union with all the countries there was not practical. If the U.K. switched to the euro it would be in the same league as countries like Germany and France. The U.K. was also on the gold standard which limited the amount of government spending. If the UK switched to the euro today, it would not be allowed to print money (i.e. inflate the euro zone economy). Instead the government would have to sell off their assets and increase taxes to meet the eurozone currency requirements. The Bank of England would also lose its independence. It would no longer control the U.K. monetary policy. Instead the ecb would control it. The euro would probably replace the pound. The British pound would no longer be accepted as the currency that people use in Britain. Inflation would rise. Britain would lose its independence in monetary policy and would be subject to an increase in taxes and decrease in spending. Finally, the pound sterling has been an important international currency. Britain would no longer get interest for holding money in the form of pounds. As inflation rose, Britain would probably have to borrow money to make its payments. However, the eurozone countries have less government debt than the pounds do, and so the interest rates could be a little higher in Britain.","The UK is unlikely to adopt the euro in the foreseeable future. The new UK Finance minister, George Osborne, reiterated this after the May 2015 general election. This is due to several factors. The main reasons why the UK has no plans to adopt the EURO are the high cost it would entail due to the large difference in size and culture, as well as the fact the UK government is very proud of the fact that they were the only country to escape the financial crisis relatively unscathed."
[INST] Stock trading after a crash [/INST],"It is very unwise to focus on events in distant parts of the world which have only a remote connection with what is happening in our economy, however it may be.  History has shown that the market will continue to grow over time.  That is why people look for investments with upside risk as a better investment than investments with downside risk, because it is not the level of expected returns that is important in the long run, it is the ""risk"" of investment.  There is always a risk that the value of investments will fall.  The risk that the value of investments will increase will always be there as well, and that risk will not change because of events outside of our own economy.  In the end, investment risk is usually measured by the volatility of returns.  The greater the expected variation (volatility) in future investment income the greater the risk being accepted.  There are measures of risk such as ""Betas"" that indicate the risk associated with a particular stock or sector.  One cannot accurately be measured by looking at the stock prices of companies that are outside of your economy, such as the stock prices of companies in a distant economy.  The US economy is largely insulated from events in other economies because it is so dominant in the world economy. To summarize, the risk of a financial crisis originating from events in Europe is minimal compared to other types of risk faced by the stock market.  Furthermore you should not invest in companies based on the fact that you think those companies will benefit from an event outside of your economy because you may be wrong in your assessment.  If you do not know what factors influence stock prices then you could easily become victim to a ""greater fool"", buying high and selling low, which is not considered a good investment strategy at all.","How does one make money from the stock markets, generally? There are 3 main ways: To some degree, your strategy can incorporate any combination of these ways.  The best advice possible would be to pick an index and re-balance periodically (say every 1 or 2 weeks) by buying or selling portions of your portfolio to keep you within some preset percentages of the index (say 2-5% off either side of the index).  If you have a lot of spare time that you are willing to spend watching the market then you may have the skill to choose stocks outperforming the market (picking 'good' stocks) and sell your picks for gains (selling 'good' stocks).  Even if you have the skill, I find that your risk goes up because of the additional cost of management and the time you spend managing your position(s), so re-balancing is an additional 'checks and balances' to prevent you from taking unnecessary risk.  Finally, if you have a lot of money (say $100k+ or you work in the financial industry, and you can get access to information) you can 'bet' on 'good' stocks by short selling stocks in the same sector (as your 'picks') for gains (selling 'bad' stocks).  Or you could try long-term options which is very similar but usually does not involve short selling."
[INST] What happens to the put option (longer expiration) of a collar if the call gets assigned? [/INST],"Collars are a hedge. What's going on here is that you were betting that a decline in the stock's price would happen, and when that didn't happen, you lost money on the put, but gained on the call. Your stock did increase in value, which was your original objective, but the put option you purchased lost some value because you'd placed a collar on it which locked it in.  I'm using this as an example because you're probably going to be interested in how the price would have varied with the timeframe in this position.","Nothing is happening to the option if this option has not been sold.  If it was sold, then there is a buyer waiting to buy it from you to close out their position. If this put option has not been sold, but you want to close it out, then you will have to look at the market. The put option will now trade as if it were free from its collar with the collar strike price removed - making it a call option.  The only way the option is getting exercised by itself is if you have sold it (someone is now long).  If it was sold, it is now trading on the market, and you want to buy it back from your customer, so you now need to pay the price it is trading on the market. You can buy the same option on the market, and it is now a ""regular"" option without the collar strike."
[INST] Is there a general guideline for what percentage of a portfolio should be in gold? [/INST],"The current amount held in gold by private individuals varies all over the place. Some people may prefer it to other safe haven / inflation hedge assets like cash or short term treasury bills. Others may feel it is too volatile and prefer it's volatility less cousins. This could change with current economic conditions too. One example with recent historical context is the current ""flight to quality"" people are making for the dollar and US debt, after the ECB / EU has been in turmoil. Currently there isn't an overwhelming consensus about gold prices, except maybe that gold has hit a price floor around $1500-1600 and that there are a large number of people who think gold is overpriced but not enough to cause a drop in the market.  It could also be that the current demand for gold coming from India and China is enough to maintain gold prices. Another possible consideration that has a very real potential of dropping gold prices are the recent changes in gold swaps agreements between central banks.  While this is a new consideration, central banks will probably always be the dominant player in gold markets and have a tendency to drive up demand when people are looking for safety.","I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this question can be better answered if you can answer these 4 questions: When we're talking about gold as an investment, we're really comparing it against stocks. Gold generally does best if the economy is weak and inflation is high. These are the conditions under which stocks will underperform.  However, if the economy is strong and inflationary pressure is low, then it's expected that stocks will perform better. I would say gold is more of a defensive asset, especially if you have a long investment horizon. Gold is much more volatile than stocks (more negative returns, greater peak to trough returns), so for the short term investor, it can be considered a speculative bet against the economy.  This is the reason why gold has had high premiums in the past.  For example, in 1980, the S&P 500's performance was in line with that of gold.  However, in the early 1980s, gold corrected down sharply while stocks continued to push higher."
[INST] Comprehensive tutorial on double-entry personal finance? [/INST],"I've never used Quicken, so I can't say if it's any good (or bad), but if you're wanting to learn double-entry bookkeeping, the program itself is not a substitute for a book.  You need to read an actual text book.  For starters, you should be able to read a balance sheet and an income statement fluently without even thinking about it.  For example, if you see the word Revenue, what you should think is Sales.  And Debits are supposed to equal credits on a ledger account.  I would seriously suggest starting at some basic books.  For example, this one. Double-entry bookkeeping is pretty easy if you're not afraid of a little math.","I'm not sure I can provide a comprehensive tutorial on personal finance management. While it's not an exhaustive list, the following topics must be understood to have a good grasp on the fundamentals... I am not aware of any book that covers each and every aspect of aforementioned list fully, including the intricacies and implications of each item to one another (and I am not even sure if the length of that book would be acceptable to the general population), so I hope someone will edit the question and add links to specific chapters of specific books instead."
"[INST] If a stock is selling for less than book value, is the company headed for bankruptcy? [/INST]","The general answer to this question is that you shouldn't make decisions just based on ratios. The price of a stock is an aggregate of what all buyers and sellers think the actual earnings will be going forward.   If the price of the stock is less than current equity book value, then that may or may not be cause for some concern about the future value of money made by the firm. You'll want to have an independent look at what the financial statements say and try to understand trends. However, in the event of a leveraged buyout or leveraged recapitalization, it is very much possible that the stocks price will be lower than book value. In general, however, if a company has assets worth more than its liabilities, its value shouldn't be dropping fast.","To add to the excellent answer by @littleadv: I'd like to point out that liquidation (what littleadv terms ""the company sold all of its parts for parts) is not the only possibility in which accounting liquidation value exceeds market value. For instance: A company could pay dividends in excess of its cash available for dividends, eventually running out of cash and becoming effectively bankrupt. The company never filed bankruptcy, all shareholders get $0, but the cash available (shareholders' equity) on the balance sheet is no less than $5 per share. A company could sell ""future product revenues"" to a third party in excess of what those future product revenues will be. The company still delivers on its promises to the third party, but in the end, it can't deliver enough actual revenue to pay the third party and its own bond holders. It goes bankrupt, but its book value was still greater than market value.  Or most interestingly, one company could merge with another at a certain multiple. Say a $10/share stock merges with a $30/share stock at a 5:2 ratio. Each share of the original $30 company trades for 2 shares of the newly formed $10 company, but the book values in this situation are (theoretically): Asset value 200mn X 2 shares $400mn Liabilities 100mn X 4 shares $400mn Equity 100mn X 2 shares $200mn Net $0 Net of liabilities: Equity $0  Market Value Liabilities 1:2 Asset Ratio 2:1. Or you could say that liabilities are at a 100% equity coverage. The point of all this is that a company could, theoretically, report that it is solvent (it can pay its bond holders) yet be trading at below book value and still go bankrupt."
[INST] Why will the bank only loan us 80% of the value of our fully paid for home? [/INST],"There are a few reasons for this. In my experience, you can put this money into whatever account you like (not a 401k) and you can usually get the interest rate higher than you would get on the savings account. You're not really sacrificing anything to save the money. Just be sure to check state or federal regulations on gifting money to minors (and the related tax issues) and plan your budget accordingly. In my experience, the only things people really need for the first few years of parenthood are the basics in the crib/changing table and the stroller, and a nice pair of shoes for the infant that will be walking in 20 minutes. You don't need a 0-6 month outfit with pants that only cover one leg. Buy clothing and accessories that can be easily be adapted to be used by next year's baby. If you can get it, buy furniture that will last from your first baby through your grandchildren. There are a few things that are worth investing in. We are trying to buy a house so we can spend less on mortgage interest and taxes. I just want to be prepared, and be a frugal as we can be. Why do people buy houses before having children? You don't need an expensive apartment by any means to have children, but don't live in the attic. Children need room to be themselves - room to stand on your feet. You should have a reasonable sized living room that your kids can play in, and rooms that are big enough so your kids don't trip over each other when you get to the point where you must share a bedroom. The only other thing I'd suggest is to buy the house outright. Your mortgage payments will be higher than if you just rent a place, and your overall housing costs will be higher also. You will need time to plan this out, but do make a plan and stick to it. Get the house paid for before the child arrives. This way you will be setting a good example of how to be frugal in your spending habits. The more money you can save up from your monthly spending, the more prepared you'll be when your other children comes along.","Your question is a bit off.  You loaned yourself 100% in your mind based on what you bought it for, not necessarily the actual value.   So they want to lend at 80% Loan to Value (LTV).  LTV is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the value or what is to be mortgaged.  For example 150k loan against 190k home = 150/190 = 78.95%  So they will lend in your case 80% Loan Amount = $144k against value of home = $182.5k. A property can decrease in value and or be refinanced depending on the bank's guidelines.   Some properties might have depreciated faster than a current value and depending on the bank they might not be willing to lend at 80% Loan to Value.  A bank might prefer a lower LTV like 75%  or they might be willing to lend to the appraised value.  Each bank has to meet FDIC & FHA standards on what they can and can not do, but also what is safe for the bank depending on the neighborhood of the location of your property and what risks they think are involved.  As long as property values hold they will allow loan ratios in the 90% range.  Refinancing is not at the discretion of the borrower based on the appraisal, you might get another appraisal that comes in over the new higher appraisal.   In your case 90% of 185k = $166,500,  I would assume this would be your limit because 90% is pretty high and the property might be worth closer to $175k, so $157.5k.  It depends on what you borrow and what the bank determines to be a safe loan to value based on the bank's guidelines and the appraised value.  You can always try to negotiate with the bank and try to get a better interest rate for a higher loan amount, or in some cases the bank will require an additional 10 percent down payment."
[INST] USA H1B Employee - Capital gains in India from selling selling stocks [/INST],"Capital gains in India are taxable in India if you're a citizen, resident, or in any other case where it doesn't have a Double Tax Treaty with the US that covers such transactions. If you're a tourist (in other words, you go visit your home country) and you decide to sell some stocks while there, you will have to pay. If you're an Indian citizen and your employer pays expenses to set you up under H Visa and your dependants visit, those expenses do not constitute taxable income in India, and hence any capital gains there won't be taxable either. India does have taxes on gifts, that being 30% per giver on sums above USD10,000.","First capital gain from shares is long term capital gain taxed at 20% [for now], that's the federal tax on USD. Depending on which state you are living - there is also state taxes (ranges from 0.9% to 12%) you may or may not have additional taxes. Also be aware about foreign tax credit restrictions, in some states you cannot save on the federal tax. If the money comes to this country - most likely you are subject to state tax, but it will depend on how the money was transferred. There are three scenarios: First - the money is transferred to you - you will have to pay a state tax no matter what (in some states up to 12%) depending on the rules of the transaction. Second - the stocks are transferred to you, and then you sell the stocks while still residing in India - you will be taxed in the US for sale and will receive a dividend from the India broker. But the cost basis of the shares will be the same as on the date you bought them. Be aware of the cost basis in all possible scenarios. You cannot be sure that the foreign broker will give you accurate cost basis on shares. Third - the money is transferred to the broker in your country, the value of shares will be transferred to the cost basis when you try to sell them. In this scenario you may get hit with 0 capital gains (in other words - you bought the shares at the price that you are trying to sell them at). But if the currency fluctation changes - you will get hit by foreign exchange gains at 30% if you are not hedged with currency options. For the third scenario - you need to consult your lawyers and CAs in India. They will tell you what to do based on the agreements that you signed when you bought the shares."
[INST] How does a portfolio of long stocks and short futures generate profits [/INST],"The basic idea behind the strategy is that you are taking a long position in the stock and shorting a ""dumb"" futures contract, the dumb futures contract in this case is based on the S&P 500 which is a widely followed index of stocks which is very well correlated with stock markets as a whole. If you think that stock prices are going to increase you want to buy stocks, so you take a long positions in the futures and short the index. If stocks do go up then you are making a profit when you sell the futures.","Your confusion arises from the fact that you are looking at the profit you're making on the stocks versus the profit on the futures contract. I'm not positive, but I think you're saying that your position is to purchase a stock and simultaneously sell a futures contract. That is a speculative position, as you're trying to predict the future value of the underlying security. You can make money on that trade, and you can lose money.  To profit on the position, it must happen that your speculative position, that on balance you're profiting $0. The only way one could lose money on that position is if one didn't hold the stock for long enough or the futures contract settled at the right level. Suppose you're looking at the position that you bought the stocks and sold the futures to an investor that wants to hedge its value in some commodity.  In that case, you're receiving money, which your risk is the company paying its debts and being profitable. The investor, is long the futures contract, but to hedge risk.  Suppose you receive $500,000 from your transaction, and your costs of selling the stocks are $1,000. You also gain your opportunity costs of selling the stocks.  And you're taking on the counterparty risk in your trade. If the investor doesn't settle the futures contract, and the company goes out of business, then the investor will owe you $500,000 and your position will be worthless."

[INST] Can someone explain the Option Chain of AMD for me? [/INST],The bid/ask is the price at which the two sides of the market are agreeing to trade. Currently for this contract there is someone who is willing to hold at the $10 ask and another who is willing to buy it at the $10 bid. If this person decided to buy and the offer was accepted it would put his price. Note also that as the price of the stock goes up the contract price may lag behind. This is caused by a premium being applied to the stock by the market when it feels the stock will be more in demand and subsequently more expensive. This is not a guarantee of performance just an illustration of what may happen if the price moves the other way. The chain shows you all the various contracts that have different strikes and maturities. It is a way of visualizing the different options available to you. Option chains are great for looking at how to best value options and for showing you how the options are related to each other.,"There seems to be more than one AMD stock.

[INST] Confirming that stocks are listed under my name [/INST],"First, your broker must do a know-your-customer check.  This requires that they require you to prove your identity somehow (through photo of passport/ID, personal information, or similar check) -- and it is reasonable for them to require that you also prove your address before authorizing any significant transactions.  This is the only way to avoid identity theft/theft by ""synthetic identities"" that are created to hide criminal activity; your broker must be in compliance with regulations to do otherwise. That being said, the brokerage is only required to keep your personal information private according to the policies of your particular jurisdiction (country/state).  It's possible that your particular broker is using another address other than your primary street address -- this may be due to a personal or cultural reason (for example, for security reasons it may not be appropriate to deliver the mail to your primary residence). In any case, your broker has no obligation to keep your information private unless this requirement is imposed by local jurisdiction (country/state/city) law. Also, keep in mind that this information is available on the public record, through your name as displayed on shares.  (It is technically illegal to look up the name on the records for this purpose, because that implies that the requestor is intending to commit fraud -- which is how this information gets leaked.)","You have to decide if you really need to know. If your funds have a 401K (or Equivalent) associated with them, then it will be tied to your Social Security number. When you die, the administrator should ask for an SS# to be listed for you, and will know automatically from that who to pay when they issue the check(s). Otherwise, assuming you have a good will, and don't mind who inherits what, and you don't have a living will (or living trust, but they are separate from wills, and should be kept distinct), the fund administrator will automatically pay your balance into the same thing - it's called being the rightful inheritor, and when there is no will, that's how things are dealt with. If it is worth the bother and the expense to take the time to find a way to list the funds you choose with each account at each company, then do it. But it is really just for the peace of mind of knowing who is on the hook for any liability, and the peace of mind of knowing it is all your choice, and will be done by your choice. It sounds like the right thing to do, but the peace of mind isn't really necessary. The peace of mind of knowing that it is possible to do it is good, but the piece of mind of knowing that it isn't really necessary (you don't need to have it on your head) isn't really a bad thing to have either."
[INST] is the bankruptcy of exchange markets possible? [/INST],"Exchange markets can't become insolvent. Unlike a bank or broker dealer, which can become bankrupt, securities exchanges do not take margin on their customers accounts. They merely provide a system for trading in securities in one central place. If the exchange were to go bankrupt, it might not be able to continue operating, at least temporarily. For example:  Some years ago the Australian Stock Exchange temporarily went offline after experiencing technical difficulties.  The Australian bank Westpac also experienced technical difficulties in recent years that led to delays in processing payments sent between accounts. These events have shown that even the world's most advanced financial exchanges can experience downtime under certain circumstances.   However, under the current system, where exchanges are centrally located, the exchanges cannot default on their obligations to clear securities transactions. In other words, even if the exchange were to close for a period, your trading activity should continue to have the same effect on your accounts, i.e., what you put in you take out. The exchange would still act as a clearinghouse for completed trades, and as long as the assets were still there, then the trades continue to transfer ownership of the stocks or securities. In fact, even an outright closure of the exchange in the same jurisdiction would not affect international securities exchanges, which can complete transactions outside the jurisdiction (the law) of the country that the exchange takes place in (in some cases, by means of subsidiaries). In effect what you could see if you close the exchanges in one jurisdiction, would be that some securities and markets could not be purchased. Or to put it another way: if it was possible for the exchange to default on its obligations under the existing system, what they defaulted would be securities trading that was completed before the system had shut down or been interrupted. This would mean that the exchange might temporarily be unable to provide certain kinds of stock if the securities had not yet been delivered to the exchange on the completion of the trading day. However, that is not what you would expect the exchange to do in such a situation, so your best bet would be to wait for the system to come back online and the securities to be delivered (since they have already been traded). I have been unable to find any articles describing either technical or intentional failures of securities exchanges causing problems for trading customers in the last 20-30 years. As such, and given that what you're asking is about an extremely unlikely or unlikely event, I'm also unable to find any further details of what might happen in such a situation. It might also be possible for national securities exchanges to be closed in some jurisdictions and not others, and that the trading business in those open exchanges could continue as normal. If you can find any further details about how securities exchanges function, then I would be very interested to hear them. I have heard of exchange trading systems being interlinked so that, for example, shares in a specific company traded on the US, European and Asian markets, could trade simultaneously. It would probably remain possible to trade securities in this manner. At present, if you were in, for example, the United States and wanted to trade a share held in China, you would need to use your broker to execute that trade on your behalf since the Chinese market is not directly linked in real-time to the US market. However, if you were able to execute your own trade in the Chinese market (which you could in theory do using a local broker using your own capital account in the Chinese bank to buy the stock, provided they have such a system in place), then that might lead to an opening up of markets. In short, even if the systems in specific jurisdictions were failing or temporarily interrupted, this does not mean that the overall system is failing or not functioning. I would expect technical and intentional failures of exchange markets to continue to be relatively rare (at least in the foreseeable future), since there is little to be gained by doing this. Indeed, in the absence of any other options, it might be possible for securities trading activity to temporarily be carried out by other means, using trading platforms not requiring any physical exchange markets. However, it is currently much easier for any one person to use an exchange market. The system we currently have is a result of decades of development and billions of dollars of investment, whereas other systems would be unlikely to be as fast and reliable as the system we currently have, if they could develop to the same standard at all. Another issue to consider is the question of ownership - what would happen to who owns what if the exchange simply shut down or defaulted on its obligations? Would the securities in question become null and void and go back to whichever party you bought them from","The answer to your question is yes and no.  In general, there is no bankruptcy of the market itself.  The bankruptcy of an exchange is a different story and yes, it is a possibility.  The exchange is just like any other business that is operating in the market.  It can go under on its own and it can be taken over or shut down by the government.  But this does not mean the market is no longer there or ceases to exist. Other parties can keep the trading going by setting up another exchange, either of the same type or another kind.  In this sense, we should not consider the exchange in itself as important as the trades that happen on it.  Also, the exchange is just one market and is not what constitutes the market itself."
[INST] What effect would sovereign default of a European country have on personal debt or a mortgage? [/INST],"A sovereign debt default does not necessarily mean they can't pay their debts. For example a country could reduce their debt by devaluing their currency (this is a form of default as the holders of the currency are accepting a haircut on their investments). Similarly, they could try the Zimbabwe route of hyperinflation, however this tends to scare the creditors leading to some form of external aid. If they do end up accepting the assistance then you must pay the risk premium over the sovereign borrowers. You can not change currencies on credit cards, so they would have to start accepting them as a valid currency, and this might not be the case.","Any default of a country would certainly have an effect on other countries' interest rates because the international markets would be concerned with the risk of other countries defaulting as well.  This would, in turn, affect mortgage rates to a certain degree.  However, in Canada, we are not all that interested in debt and we also happen to have a sound economy and currency.  We may therefore be able to have a bit of an insulation over the other countries which are less-well-off... which may help us avoid a total mortgage-market meltdown."
"[INST] The doctor didn't charge the health insurance in time, am I liable? [/INST]","You should get with the doctor's office immediately.  Your health insurance policy might state that you are liable, but I doubt it. If they don't respond, I'd go see a lawyer. When you got your car insurance a few months ago, did you not have to pay the full price, because they are covering the cost of the accident?","There are no laws in the U.S. that allow you to do anything other than pay the hospital directly. If the hospital is going to do what it takes to collect a debt, the insurance companies can't do a thing to stop them. There are also laws that protect you against lawsuits, so even if a hospital does something completely inappropriate and unscrupulous, you may be powerless to stop them and they may end up wasting a lot of your time and money defending yourself. The best thing to do is to contact your insurance company early and try to settle the bill early. When negotiating a debt of this type you should remember that you are dealing with individuals who have a job as a collections agent or as a debt collection manager. You are dealing with people who get paid per deal, who have goals to achieve, and they have no empathy for you as a consumer. When negotiating you should act as if it is in your best interests to play a game with them because their best interests are to get you to pay."
[INST] How to distinguish gift from payment for the service? [/INST],"Unless you know the giver to be lying or evil, there's no need to be concerned with this.  The giver knows why they are giving you a birthday/christmas present, and you know why you are accepting a birthday/christmas present as a gift. The person who gave you the birthday present bought it with a check from the bank because that's the only form of payment they have, and you accepted it because they bought it for you. You could use the same logic I assume you used when you were younger and wanted a bicycle: ""Why do I need to return this 10 dollar bill? I know dad can afford to give a gift"".","There are many different ways to deal with this. If you do not want to invoice for the 100$ gift then just don't issue the invoice. If you do want to, there are many ways of handling it. Personally, since the gift is given in the same day, and we will not bill the cost of the gift on it, I do it like this. So, we bill the gift without any amount. We just mention in the note that it was a gift. We add a payment on the same day with the correct amount for the gift. And then we close it. The next invoice will be only with the other costs. Another way could be to split the invoice in 2 invoices, one without amount for the gift, closed,and one with the correct amount for the full amount of the invoice. And again there are many more options."

The idea is that he can ride them out, but when the market is up, it will grow much faster than his cash sitting on the sidelines and he'll miss some growth. I'm sure it's not quite that simple.","When Warren Buffett writes about his track record's relationship to the U.S. market's movements, his main point is actually the opposite of what you suggest he is saying; i.e. in a rising market, performance will lag. He believes, in part through evidence he cites, that his investment style relies on the companies he acquires to keep paying their shareholders a dividend, while most dividends will be frozen or cut when the market is falling, increasing the lag. It's a short article and worth reading for more details."
"[INST] If throwing good money after bad is generally a bad idea, is throwing more money after good Ok? [/INST]","In the case of an investment it may be appropriate, just as a gambler will often stay on one table as long as he's on a losing streak but will change tables when he wins. On the other hand, we may have the same thing we have in personal relationships. If we keep seeing evidence that someone won't change to be faithful, for example, then we may need to move on, but if things improve to the level we're happy with, we'll want to keep things going in a positive direction.","In this case, I think you can consider putting more money into the project a good investment if: The initial failure may be attributed to underfunding, which was a reason why project A did not get enough attention in the first place, then more funds can help project A succeed in the second attempt.  If the initial failure can be rectified (e.g. a product recall), then it is likely that some of the funds previously spent will not be wasted, just reallocated. These are two situations where the additional investment is potentially worthwhile. In all other cases I would consider it a waste of money"
[INST] Should the price of fuel in Australia at this point be so high? [/INST],"This question is about Australia, not the USA.  I think it's been established that the refining side of things is quite healthy in the USA, and it's a bit unclear exactly what's going on with prices in Australia. You need to ask a more focused question: What's the problem with the supply of fuel in Australia? I'm not an expert, so I can't answer that question. I suggest you do some more research.","If the demand for fuel is constant, then the suppliers of fuel have all the power to set the price. A good example is the cost to fly within the US.  Fuel comprises 45% of the total cost for domestic flights.  A gallon of fuel on the spot market costs $2.58 today, and according to Reuters, will likely go up to the $3.00 mark by mid-year.  The spot price of the gallon of fuel varies around $2.30 to $2.44 per gallon. (Historical chart here.) Fuel prices are tied closely to the wholesale price of crude oil.  You can see an example of this on the US chart. Fuel prices for Australia have been high for many years now, well before the events of the past year in Europe."
[INST] How accurate is Implied Volatility in predicting future moves? [/INST],"A great question!  This answer, given in layman's terms, attempts to quantify ""Implied Volatility"" in a way that makes sense to understand its relationship to real stock performance. ""Implied Volatility"" is a measure that takes a lot of components and sums them to give you a single number on a percent scale. The percent that the number equals indicates just how much the market thinks an option contract will move during the time period of the option contract you are looking at.  So let's explore the components for a little bit. First, I will use the SP500 index as an example. An option for the SP500 index can be an American-style option, which means that trading can take place throughout the term of the contract, which is usually until expiration date of the contract. Alternatively, these options can be European style, where trading can take place only until 3pm NYSE/NASDAQ and 4pm Chicago Mercantile Exchange(CME). As of this writing, the closing level for the SP500 index  is 1203.32.  The options contract that is ""In The Money""(ITM) is the February 2014 contract. The SP500  implied volatility as estimated by the CBOE is 16.25%. This means that the market expects that the SP500 index will move with in this percent of the index over the remainder of the contract period. However, on average, this is not the correct number we should be examining to get a true sense of how volatile the market expects the stock to be since the market might be looking out only 6 months as opposed to 1 year.  The correct measure is the implied volatility divided by the SQRT(time). Time is calculated by dividing the number of days left in the contract period by the number of trading days in the contract period. So if we are looking at a February 2014 option, the remaining time in the option period is 198 days or 6.3549 days.  So we have a total time of 14,625 minutes. But since most markets are open only 10 hours during the week, we should average time of 90,123 minutes (28,040 trading minutes). So the correct implied volatility for the Feb2014 option at this time is about 16.7%: 16.25%/(SQRT(198/14,625)). This is still a large number, but it should show the market's expectation on its volatility. Now lets look at the options a year out. The contract for February 2015 shows an even higher implied volatility at 19.6%. So this could seem a little strange, but on average for the past year, February 2014 has had an implied volatility of 16.2%. The implied volatility for February 2015, given the current market sentiment of low volatility based on an S&P 500 index of 1203.32, the volatility should correct downward to 12.12% and this is approximately a 36% drop from the current implied volatility of 19.6%. Another way to interpret the implied volatility numbers is 3 standard deviations. So if we plot the implied volatility levels on a cumulative distribution curve, the probability of being on the downside of the current curve is 3 standard deviations higher than the true value, or 99.87% or almost a 90% chance of being on the downside of the current distribution. This shows that the market is extremely bullish and believes the market will go up a very large amount during the time period of the option contract. While the information above gives you some insight on the meaning of implied volatility using this layman's terms, you will only find this to be accurate in the long term of the market. So in the next day, week, month, or even year the current estimate of the implied volatility will be meaningless in the short term and provide limited value. I hope this helps you as a quick understanding of the meaning of implied volatility.","Why do people say IV is bad at predicting future moves? It is the IV that's calculated based on people's predictions about the price in the future. And then people say: ""Gee we thought prices would climb like 20% so why did options trade with a volatility of under 20%?"" Yet people forget: ""20% is too high, so why didn't prices decline?"" Yet they buy back options that are trading with IVs that would predict price increases and then say: ""Implied volatilities are too high.""  The best volatilities to use aren't necessarily the ones available on the market at any time. They are the volatilities that best represent what the market actually thinks things are going to do. To obtain these volatilities, one must adjust volatilities up or down, which is an active process in a trading room. Then at the end of the day, one can go back and see how their volatilities predicted what actually happened in the market. For instance, if after a long bull run in a volatile stock, you would adjust IVs upwards to make the model more bearish. If the stock went up some more, you would eventually adjust IVs downward to make the model more bullish.  The problem of course is that there are many people out there using their own models with their own IVs and everyone has a different take because everyone has different opinions on what the market is going to do and different models that are based on differing assumptions.   So if we don't know each trader's opinion and assumptions, then we really don't know why they are trading and whether their implied volatilities are good or not. To know that you will have to be in the trader's head."
[INST] Stock market vs. baseball card trading analogy [/INST],"I think you might have the opposite impression that you intended.  You are arguing that people would have the incentive to cheat and that I'm arguing that they have the incentive not to cheat.  However, I believe I'm arguing that people do have the incentive to cheat, but that there are other forces that may lead to honest trading. I think you are missing a crucial distinction between baseball cards and stocks, which is the legal framework governing the securities markets.  Baseball cards may very well be subject to securities laws, especially if the exchange/dealer is considered to be ""dealing in securities"" which would include selling, offering to sell or buying any security issued by a person or entity other than the dealer.  Thus, the dealer must keep track of and report any sales made, and must keep a written and/or oral record of any transactions.  So even if the dealer could get away with selling ""counterfeit"" baseballs, they would not be able to forge any contracts for ""legitimate"" transactions.  Furthermore, other restrictions may exist.  For example, dealers are typically not allowed to short a security, and they may be required to purchase a security after selling it under certain conditions, known as a ""Good faith obligation"", or a ""sell out rule"".   While it is more complicated than this, but these points should make the distinction between the ""securities markets"" and baseball cards.  Securities markets such as stocks (and derivatives) are extremely regulated with heavy focus on ""market integrity"".   On the other hand, as you stated, the baseball card market is extremely unregulated.  However, I think we would agree that even though baseball cards have more incentive to be forged, it still happens only occasionally and that the market is still considered ""honest"".   So, to answer your question at the end.  Should the market be so regulated as to make them more honest?  Yes, in my opinion the stocks are so regulated already.   Edit:  To address the comments, I believe the main benefit of regulation is to make it possible to establish a market.  I'm not referring to any regulation regarding the actual trading of securities, so for example, a market for baseball cards would still need to be established in order for regulation to do any good.  If it is assumed that investors should already be confident in a market, then I agree regulation would do more harm than good.  However, to build confidence in an established market, regulation can do some good.  I am not arguing that it should all be deregulation, but rather that there is probably an optimum level of regulation that would create the best outcome for ""all involved"".","The reason is that the value of the stock market over the long term has risen faster than the value of baseball cards or even most other items over the last 150 years or so. As a result, in a long period of time, it is possible to make a large profit on a single stock, while the most valuable baseball card may very well have been a rare 2000 year old copy of Sidd Finch Strikes Out. As a result, it is rare for a baseball card player to make a huge profit, but this is a regular occurrence in the stock market. (A $5 stock rising to $50 over 30 years means the value is multiplied 10 fold; a rare baseball card rising from 50 to $500000 means the value is only multiplied about 100 fold. It's possible, but unlikely).  I can't think of an example at the moment of the most expensive baseball card ever, but any of the expensive cards are likely of the same price in today's dollar terms as the most expensive rare stocks were a hundred years ago."
[INST] Hedging against an acquisition of a stock [/INST],If you are concerned that Apple is going to take over your favorite company you can sell the shares instead of betting on an acquisition that may never take place. You can do this by setting up a Limit or Stop order in a broker that allows you to set these types of orders for your transactions.,"No. You would use puts. This is different from a short selling situation. 1) In a short you are expecting to make a profit through a decrease in price. (This is the opposite of what you need). 2) In a short, even though you hope for the price to fall, it will not hurt you if the price does not move because you only pay if the stock drops and you have sold shares to someone else.  In your put option situation, you hope that nothing happens to your stock but pay if the price increases (or stays the same). 3) In a short, you are shorting shares of a specific company. If the company gets taken over, you have nothing to worry about unless the new company forces you to deliver the shares (i.e.- you are holding shares in IBM but IBM gets bought out and the new company still requires you to deliver shares).  By buying a put, you are betting on the underlying company and not the other players in the market. 4) In a short, you have no other control on what happens to the price.  In a put option, you have the option to exercise it at a certain time - meaning the future price."
[INST] Should I invest in a Health Insurance +1 policy from my Employer? [/INST],"If you're a single guy with no dependents, then a high deductible health plan (HDHP) is probably not right for you.  An HDHP is, as the name implies, a health plan which has a high deductible.  In exchange for accepting (on average) higher costs for care (outpatient, medical, urgent care, and ER visits, prescriptions, annual physicals, flu shots, etc.), the insurance company in return charges you lower rates for your health insurance (or lower employer contributions and you pay a lower monthly premium).  In short this means that you save money on health insurance, but you save because you are taking on more of the financial responsibility for medical payments than you would on a traditional, ""non-catastrophic"" or ""major medical"" plan. In other words, even though many people who have HDHPs don't actually pay the full deductible, the higher the deductible in effect the more they are paying out of pocket.  Some employers offer HSA-qualified health plans in place of HDHPs with the option to use HSAs (see below for more info on HSAs) or FSAs (see below for more info on FSAs) to pay co-payments (such as for office visits or prescriptions), co-pays for co-insurance requirements (such as for hospital care), and to pay deductibles.  HSAs and FSAs must meet certain limits for annual contributions (both amounts and annual increases or limits on annual increases in your employee contributions) to qualify to receive tax benefits, such as tax deductible contributions and tax free distributions (withdrawals) for eligible expenses (such as out of pocket medical expenses in excess of your HSA contributions + annual expenses in excess of your HSA balance). Most people would not benefit financially from HDHPs, since out-of-pocket costs for typical health expenses (out of pocket medical expenses in excess of your HSA contributions and annual expenses in excess of your HSA balance), typically will cost significantly more than they would for a tradition, non-catastrophic health plan (which typically has lower deductibles and higher co-insurance or greater contribution for co-pays).  Also, most people with employer-sponsored benefits will not spend in excess of their HSA contributions + annual expenses in excess of their HSA balance, since most HSAs have combined deductible + employer contribution + annual deductible amounts which often exceed average annual out-of-pocket expenses for most.  Therefore, HSAs and HSA qualified plans are typically right for people who are ""fresh out of college and ready to buy their first home"" or people who are ""nearing retirement and worried about future health care costs and want to begin saving for medical expenses that are not covered by Medicare"" and other people who have other reasons to benefit (in terms of lower out-of-pocket expenses + more savings for medical expenses) from HSA qualified HDHPs.  In summary, since HSAs typically have more annual requirements for contributions (both employer and employee contributions and yearly increases to limits on annual contributions), as well as yearly requirements for medical expenses and yearly expenses in excess of your HSA balance, typically the lower annual contribution limits for HSA qualified HDHPs combined with the higher annual expenses for out-of-pocket medical expenses in excess of HSA contributions plus annual expenses in excess of your HSA balance do not make these HSA qualified plans right for a single individual with no dependents. Even if they have high-deductible employer health care plans available, I'd say they sound too risky. Unless you have something to offset high deductibles, such as some sort of cash or medical account you fund or have set aside for such a case, deductibles are a bit risky. It might be a better idea to look for an employer that has a plan which covers most or all of the deductible, even if the monthly premiums are more expensive than some competitors. If your employer is paying, it is up to them to keep health care expenses low, not you. Many of the employers I've work for who offered high-deductible plans also pushed the HSA (Health Savings Accounts) option on you. If that's the case, you might want to take a close look at it. These accounts were designed to have very lenient rules: the yearly contribution ceiling for HSA's is very high at over $6,600 for family plans - that's twice as high as 401Ks! Plus, the money is your's forever, even if you leave your employer or that employer","Unless you understand why your employer is doing it and what you can get from it, I'd avoid it.  There are a lot of things that can go wrong with insurance and your employer buying it for you is one of them. Is your company financially stable?  Would they make it through bankruptcy?  If not, then insurance providers would stop paying benefits and then you'd be in an awkward situation with the IRS and the insurance companies."
"[INST] If I have some old gold jewellery, is it worth it to sell it for its melt value? [/INST]","The question is more properly phrased as: ""How can I determine the value of my gold and silver jewelry in order to decide whether to sell it""? A good question but the way you phrased it implies that the melt value is somehow different, a way to cheat the seller, I can't say. Value = Replacement + Material + Wear Sentiment (value) A new necklace in an older style (the only thing of that style) may be worth as much due to its rarity in any condition. Same necklace, new to you but old to everyone else may not be worth as much. I recently sold gold to a gold buyer who claimed to pay me more when I showed him an ad. He claimed he was paying what the gold was worth but the ad listed a store where the gold could be bought. A store that has already paid 20 percent at wholesale! I know if my stuff was worth that much we wouldn't need someone like him to buy it. He was trying to cheat me out of my profit. Jewelry is an emotional purchase. You're buying someone's sentiment in those purchases. Your jewelry may have no resale market value but still hold value for you.","It is not as bad a deal now because gold and silver are now more valuable than they were recently. However, it is still likely to be a poor deal. The most expensive part of gold, platinum or any precious metal jewellery is the ""labor"" cost. To get the gold from the ore to the finished product is very expensive, then the jewelry manufacturers charge premiums for the design and workmanship. To sell your items as melt value gold, you must have it refined down back into the raw gold nugget, which means that the precious metal has to be taken away from the stonework and other precious metals and minerals. The gold that you see in jewellery is only about 75%, which means that all other other items are scrap and must be taken off and sent to the recycling industry. After your jewelry is ""reduced"" to the raw nugget, it has to be assayed to see that it is up to the new minimum standards. If it passes assay, it then becomes 95% -100% pure and can be used to make new gold bars. It is from this gold that the refineries get their ""golden bars"". However, I would also like to say that ""melt value"" is the least desirable method. The highest ""return"" on these items is from being recycled and refined back into anew piece of fine jewelry. Then your piece can be sold on ebay or directly from a personal ad as a quality piece from your estate.  In regards to a jewelry refiner that also recycles, I would recomend you check in Los Angeles with The House of Gold - 800.557.7090.  They have a great buy/refine/sell process."
[INST] How can I detect potential fraud in a company before investing in them? [/INST],"This is very difficult for an individual.  Some of the more obvious signs - too good to be true investment prospects, unethical conduct in the past, criminal activities, bankruptcies if it was a past business, questionable accounting statements, management turn-over - but the real value of stock analysis is identifying a good business.  The real value of the company is in the ability to capture a large part of the profit for the money you lent.  If you find a good business, you are more likely to find that management will make you a profit.  The more profitable that the business is, the more likely you will find fraud.  A business that is highly profitable is more likely to have internal fraud.  Many of the frauds involve colluding management and executives - for example, there have been frauds that were highly profitable because they had the business understate its costs.  The business would take advantage of suppliers by paying them late and getting some better deals or not paying them at all and they would get some cash from customers and use that to pay salaries.  In this case, there is no reason to detect fraud, you simply want to ensure that your investment returns are not being eaten away by frauds or poor management.  Of course, poor management can eat away at your investment, but, in this case, the fact that the business could produce profits if its managers were better demonstrates that it is a good business that will have a low future rate of return but still make a profit.  You could go through the steps of looking at financial statements and reading the latest news about the company to detect frauds, but that would be a lot of work for you.  It is a different question if all the information you need to make your profit is published in public records and you have the time or the inclination to find the frauds.",What you are doing is good: looking at financial reports.  What can you actually see in the reported financial data or the way they report the financial data that would tip you off?  Here are some areas to explore:
[INST] Can I prove having savings without giving out the account number? [/INST],"There are a variety of ways to get information to a prospective employer by which they could verify that you have savings. Firstly, you could provide some of your financial information through an online brokerage.  The brokerage, in turn, could send a verification letter to your prospective employer.  Most brokerages offer this service. Note that although the prospective employer can learn a lot of information from this letter, they will not be able to withdraw from, transfer, or add to any account(s) which you have via the broker.  They will also not have access to your savings accounts or account balances, but might be able to obtain this information if you voluntarily allow them to obtain it. Note that all brokerages will be asking for certain personal information before it will send your verification letter to the employer.  Be aware that when you provide the personal information you are effectively giving the bank permission to send the information to a specified third party. Second, your own bank, with your consent, could send a verification of your savings to anyone you so choose.  In the US, all federally regulated banks send out the verification letters. Some state chartered banks that are not federally regulated might not send the verification letters, but you could contact them to confirm. Note that with this option you do not have to voluntarily give out personal information such as your account number and balance.  Also be aware that the bank will not be able to send the verification to anyone (such as your prospective employer) unless you request the bank to do so. Third, you could provide the employer with some other form of tangible proof that you have a savings account such as a recent bank statement, the account number itself, or even providing access to your savings account via a brokerage.  However, you should be aware that this option has the biggest risk of identity theft.  If you know the person who is reading the information, they will see your name and account number along with your balance (or they could request a recent statement showing it).  Even if the person is ""honest"" and only shows your account number, it may be misplaced and could lead to identity fraud later. Fourth, if this entire problem started because someone did not like you or you are not being paid what you are worth, you could contact your local branch of your union.  If the union is aware that the employer is holding your savings account as a means to pay you less than you are worth, the union could demand a raise, file a complaint, or take other measures.",I think that you can always do the following while giving minimum information: I agree with @littleadv that you should probably be careful not to put yourself at unnecessary risk and that you should not let your financial information be known to strangers you have no trust.

"[INST] US citizen sometimes residing in spain, wanting to offer consulting services in Europe, TAXES? [/INST]","In addition to what others have said (which is all the information you need), here's what I have to add. You should seriously consider a registered business in Spain, with Spain only being a passport country for you (maybe US in addition). You may be able to get by as a freelance consultant with the only tax requirement being that you register under the Self Employed Act (autonomo) with your local tax office before registering any invoices. You don't need to incorporate or set up any kind of legal business. I would, however, contact an expat tax advisor as there are some special requirements and procedures if you have non-resident income from US. Your advisor will tell you. In most countries you get to take certain expenses and the total for all of that (the ""basically"") will be the amount over which the tax is applied.  In Spain you get most expenses back and you have to pay a minimum tax of approximately 27,810 euro as if you had no expenses. As an example, if you have non-resident consulting contracts in UK and Portugal, you could pay the minimum tax for Spain as a resident and then receive credit for the tax already paid abroad if you have filed and paid your taxes abroad. Of course your advisor will give you more detailed advise about deductions available in your country of residence. And the advisor will help you file in Spain to get the taxes paid abroad credited.","Are you going to be an employee of a company in Spain?  From the question, it sounds like you're going to be an independent contractor.  In general, the rules for independent contractors are simpler and not subject to nearly as many hoops as employees are. The easiest thing would be to not have an office or business premise in Spain, and to not sign any contracts for work based in Spain.  Instead, you could work on projects that originate in your country, use your equipment and provide services remotely, which your employer, client, etc., will probably prefer as well. For income taxes, if you do any actual work for a company in Spain, in Spain, and receive money from them: you'll have two major taxes to pay: a tax on income and a value-added tax (VAT: taxes on sales made) that might apply to you, even though you're technically not paying sales tax.  In Spain, they call the tax on income and taxes on profits by some other name.  It's not an income tax, it's a tax on earnings.  And it's not just on income that you keep.  It's on all the receipts you make, except for certain categories which are exempt.  You might be able to work it out if you are self-declared and know the exemptions and their limits.  What I meant was: it's not just the money you get the keep, its the whole amount your company brings in.  The Spanish tax authorities will expect to see all the receipts (from all sources) and determine  if all is accounted for and all is in order, without any over-taxation or under-taxation.  This means for tax purposes, you might not be allowed to not count income from a few sources. There's also the VAT tax, which is a standard tax on all sales, as well as special VAT rates for some goods (e.g. foods, books, and certain categories of industrial products). If you're going to have an office and you already have taxes, that's another matter to resolve.  The best answer for that problem is to know exactly what taxes you're already paying, the conditions for exemptions, the exemptions you're allowed, and to talk to a tax adviser.  That's someone who might also know the differences between consulting and employee-type relationships, as well as any changes in tax law for foreigners working in another country. Your tax adviser might also advise you on tax treaties: that is, international agreements that are meant to balance out taxes paid on one end if a person is also being taxed on the other end.  Most treaties are bilateral, between two countries (e.g. USA -- Spain).  The treaties in effect will either prevent a person from being taxed in two different countries at one time, or they may reduce the taxes due in one country (to reduce the tax rates and prevent overtaxation).  If you're going to have two tax adviser, I'd definitely talk to both of them.  The tax adviser can also advise you on whether you need to pay a tax called the retention tax and whether you'll need a local tax identification number, and he might know about some special exceptions made for people in your specific category. If you're already paying taxes in your country, you should find out if you're exempt from these taxes in the country where you want to be paid.  It might prevent them from forcing you to pay both sets of taxes.  You should also look into tax treaties in your country: If you are resident for tax purposes in your  country, and you work in Spain for a long time, that might constitute income/earnings in that country.  This means you'd be taxed by the Spanish tax authorities, and be exempt in a similar fashion in your own country (for as long as you're out of the country). You tax advisor in your own country might be able to advice which of either Spain or your own country you should register taxes to, if you're registered in your own country and you're technically exempt and registered in Spain.  This can affect you if you come back to your own country.  Spain will take tax exemption credits from a country, such as the USA.  When you return to the USA, you become resident but Spain has already taken exemptions for you.  But when you return, you can use your tax credits already paid to Spain, and not pay as much taxes."
[INST] How can I get a home loan within 2 years of bankruptcy? [/INST],"It's possible, but won't happen quickly. One approach which may yield quicker results is to begin with the mortgage itself. Try to get pre-approved for as much as you can. Then try to talk with mortgage agents about being approved for the purchase now, but doing the closing on the loan 2 years from now. The closing date of the loan would then go on your application for credit. This shows you paid on time and have built a track record of responsibility. But the bank does get to take the risk, in case you lose your job, can't afford the payments, etc. The pre-approval shows your intentions are to pay for you've said you can, and the 2 year wait will show that you had no problem doing so in the past.","Borrowing within the first couple of years is actually going to be possible, if you are honest and realistic about your position. The most obvious thing to do is to look out for bad loans - avoid the typical 'buy to let', and other exotic loans. Avoiding borrowing at all, especially secured loans, will make your credit history much better, and you are much more likely to get a mortgage. Borrowing £5000 for a car is unlikely to make any real change or difference, unless you go to an ethical lender who doesn't report the payments history and credit card debt to the credit agencies, in which case I think what is more likely is that your credit history will improve. There are websites which contain guides to the different credit scoring systems used, and the exact scoring methodology is a trade secret. Most of your score will consist of the recent history, so if you miss no payments, and pay a large amount of debt off you would be well served with this approach. So you can get a second on the house, but don't expect any loans or anything, and certainly don't expect to be offered decent or attractive rates of borrowing for another year, until you start building up your credit history.  It might be worth looking at renting out the bedroom, as you would build a better credit history quickly, and earn a larger income, but you will have to be more string in your requirements and be more careful with the people you let in, as it could go very wrong."
[INST] Working in Iran for foreign company [/INST],"If you are trying to earn the foreign currency then you are trying to earn dollars. I believe the foreign currency rate was  about $1 dollar for 12000 to 12500 Iranian rials? If this is correct than you can do the following and earn $100 per month. You just need $250 to start; which will be $ 50,000 rials. You do not need to put the whole sum of $1,000 because you can always sell a portion of it and withdraw and you can do it anytime, so you can do this multiple times and earn more dollars! Just remember that at one point the Iranian government announced that foreign currency rates can be changed at any time. As of July 2018, you could withdraw up to 1 million Euros in cash. What you need to do in Iran in order to gain dollars is follow the steps below: After opening the account ask for USD in 100 denomination bills. If you are not lucky enough to get all bills in 100 denomination you can exchange 5 dollar bills with the teller. (you should ask for the teller by name) For some reason the other foreign currency bank employees do not have the ability to exchange 5 denomination dollars!  This is to your advantage. The dollar bills from your teller will come from the US embassy money deposited by the US government. So you will always have clean and good bills! Now it is time to exchange your dollars, just have cash of 10 rials around to show to the government money exchange store before you even reach the counter to exchange.","When you have a problem, it's better to use your own words to explain what you want to do. You can read more about this here. Then you can ask your question. But, in general, you would like to know about working in Iran for a foreign company. You may also read more tips about how to earn money in Iran from the web."
[INST] How does anyone make significant money on very low volume stocks? [/INST],"If it makes you feel better - the only way you'll turn a profit on these stocks is by having a high liquidity and by selling at the ASK price, so on most days (as the stock is illiquid) you're going to experience significant slippage in your profits. On days the stock becomes very active (as in it's going crazy) it's likely to be on the move up, ie the trading volume won't be that high and there won't be as many sellers as there is now, so you'll experience quite significant slippage on sell orders. You're much safer selling during periods of low trading activity, during these periods you'll receive the ask-price 100% of the time.","The most common way is to manipulate the price.  This can be done via pump and dump, ""short and distort,"" or market manipulation. Many such securities will have little public float, so trading in these shares will be less conducive to normal market mechanisms."
[INST] Will a credit card company close my account if I stop using it? [/INST],"Unless the credit card is a ""credit-only"" card, a card that can only be used for balance transfer, or has a credit limit that's so high you can never use it to buy (and repay) your purchases in full, you should use your credit card every month and pay it in full. That's what you need to do in order to build good credit. However, they can close your account without notice if they catch you doing something they consider fraudulent. For example the Chase Bank account (which is actually Marathon Bank in the Cayman Islands but Chase does the banking for them) and their account-to-account transfer system have the lowest credit score of anything I've ever come across. In order to initiate a transfer you sign into their system and type the name, routing number, and account number from your bank account. Then you agree to pay them $100 per transaction. This process is called a ""wire transfer"" but it is not really a wire transfer. So after using this method once or twice, your new credit card gets its first inquiry. Within a month, your score drops by 100 points on the Experian scale. Then your next credit card application is rejected and you don't know what just happened to your score, so you ask about it and are told...  ""Because you applied for credit"" - as if applying for ""credit"" were a crime or something (and as if a credit score of 200 even remotely reflects being a ""suspect"" of any crime), then you are basically left hanging by a card company that does not seem to care about the business you would provide if they gave you an explanation of what happened to your score that would allow you to bring it back up. I was told the only thing I could do is pay for an expensive monthly service and hope that it works for me. That's not going to happen. So if a credit card company wants to help me build my credit and keep their existing customers they should not close my account without due cause.","There are laws against closures due to inactivity, so you're not going to be shut down for having a card in a drawer for a short time. There used to be ""sleeping"" fees, a sort of annual fee for those unused accounts; it was considered an annoyance to those who held accounts as a backup when a card was lost, it would still have been usable and paid for. As with everything else financial though, it was a case of ""you have the option of not paying it"". Many people have commented that this was a way of getting rid of those who weren't current, and probably in one fashion or another, there was no ""we really want you to use your card"" aspect at all. If you just let a card go for some period of time (even 4-6 months), you will likely see a reduction in credit available somewhere else. I don't think it's just the account, so keeping the account open, but not using, won't do what you hope."
[INST] Am I legally allowed to offset the tax I pay on freelance work? (UK) [/INST],"Do you have a company? If not, you have some time to create one, then transfer the money into this company and it becomes much easier to transfer the money from a foreign client. You also need to know the country you are receiving the money from, some have tax treaties with the UK and others don't.","You get your deductions if you're running a business where you sell services or items. So if you're selling web design services, for example, then you're allowed to write off some of your overhead expenses (website hosting, paying contractors to do work, etc) because you're paying for business expenses... You would be allowed to write off, for example, the contract you had with the web design company to build your own site. So you do have business expenses you can write off and your tax bill will reflect this with a lower amount. If this is your first time dealing with the government, then I suggest reading up on how tax breaks work and make sure that you follow the rules and don't do anything illegal that will get the business shut down! Good luck :)"
[INST] Are banks really making less profit when interest rates are low? [/INST],"Banking isn't the only business that makes money on transactions, and they're not as constrained about moving money as some of the others in the business. Some transactions have to be executed by the bank, such as buying stocks or bonds. Other transactions have to be executed by market makers, such as buying a currency or trading a CDS. I'm not sure what's the most complicated. A high rate is a win for savings, but it makes loans more complicated. A low rate can mean more profit on loans and deposits, but a low rate makes investment harder.","I'm not 100% sure that this is true. What I've seen in the news about JC Penney's situation is that they had a really lousy Christmas season, that their inventory of unsold goods is in a bad place, and that as they are clearing out this inventory, they need money to do it. That's probably not what they were expecting. What is happening to JC Penney is probably happening to others, too. Also, banks are losing money on derivatives right now. I'd imagine that there are other factors, as well. But the bottom line is that something is going on that's making businesses' cash flow a little tight for whatever reason. My assumption would be that it is because the consumers, in their own problems, are not spending."
[INST] Will an ETF increase in price if an underlying stock increases in price [/INST],"Yes: It depends on what the index does. If it is an industry standard index such as PSE Composite Index or DJIA, your ETF will follow.","When the underlying stock price increases, a positive correlation should exist between the 2, which will increase the price of the exchange-traded fund containing that stock."
"[INST] As a total beginner, how do I begin to understand finance & stocks? [/INST]","You asked about stock purchases, but first read about how the market works.  It will get your mind working in the right direction.  Do not think about the stock exchange as a place where real wealth is generated.  That is not its purpose.  Read everything you can find about the market.","When you first hear about investment, you might be afraid of it because it is a word related to finance and money, but don't be worry. Let me tell you some good things about investment.  (1) In principle, saving money for the future is investment. Whether it is money in your savings account, money you invest in real estate, money you give to help your loved ones, these are all types of investment. In this sense, you can say that your wallet is an investment tool. (2) One way to do investment is to buy and hold. With this method, what you do is to identify a company or business that has good profit growth in the future, and you buy the company's shares. The longer you hold this investment, the greater your profit will be. Let me use the company ""Google"" as an example because it is easy to understand. Google's annual revenue is growing at a rate of 60%. If you assume that the rate continues to grow at this rate of 60% for 30 years, then at the 30th year of investing in Google, you will have $11,048 of profits. Let's assume that Google shares are $600 and that the dividend yield is 2%. You would generate $332 for dividends. This will mean a total profit of $11,380. To calculate how much profit you would make if you put your money in a saving account, you would need to calculate interest compounded annually. If you invested $20,000 and the interest rate was 3%, then after 30 years, your profit would be $2,998. This means that if you invest in an interest-bearing bond, and that bond has the following characteristics, your final saving profit would be $11,332. Not bad, but it would be better to invest in Google! Of course, as a beginner, I advise you not to invest in 1 stock. The following are ways you can diversify your investment:  A) Equity mutual funds     B) Exchange-Traded Funds  (3) One important point to understand is volatility (how much the stock price increases or decreases) and risk (the chance of your money being lost). Most mutual funds have lower risk and the risk increases as you focus more on individual stocks. If there is a risk you might lose the whole investment, then you are taking more risk. But if you are patient, you will have longer time to recover your loss. In the stock market, there are different types of traders. The long term traders have a lot of patience and therefore their risk is lower. On the other hand, the short term trader usually has higher risk than the long term trader. For example, if there was a company that reported its earnings higher than the analysts expectation, why would the long term trader buy the stock? It is because they believe that the company would have high profit growth for the next 20 years, and they are therefore willing to wait longer to obtain a share of all this profit growth. On the other hand, the short term traders usually buy the company's stock because they believe these higher earnings will cause the stock price to rise in the short term. The short term traders tend to buy and sell on a larger scale than the long term traders so their risk is higher. However, if they can predict the future stock price even better than the long term traders, if they time the trade exactly right and sell the stock just before the price falls again, then they can profit more than the long term traders. (4) In 2012, if I wanted to invest in a company, there are 2 ways to do it:  A) I can buy shares in a stock market and become a shareholder of that company  B) I can purchase this company I want to invest in and be the sole manager of that company This means that I get to choose every decision that is made with that company to obtain the highest benefit for myself. In 2016, I can no longer do B. In fact, in 2016, I don't have to physically buy and hold the shares in the drawer because if I wanted to invest $5 million in a company, I would have to find out its listed company's share price, divide $5M by the share price, then buy 29,200 shares to get the company I wanted. I'm not saying that the $29,200 shares will be difficult for me to hold.  It is just difficult to get $29,200. The exchange traded funds (ETF) is now providing a new way of"
[INST] LLC in states with customers with and without employees in the state [/INST],"The LLC must pay taxes and file and LLC in every state from which the LLC derives income. Thus your LLC based in Florida will have to file paperwork, and pay taxes in Florida and every other state where it earns income. This may or may not include tax nexus based on physical presence. If your business does not physically deal in the state of your customer, you will not be taxed for that state since you have no nexus.  Consult your tax advisor regarding individual questions because rules are state specific and change often and with the new tax plan. Note - LLC is NOT a tax status, it is a corporate structure. When you file to form an LLC, you will choose how the LLC will be taxed. For a business that operates in one state, it will likely operate as a Disregarded entity or Partnership - which means that for federal tax purposes, the LLC is not a legal entity. Instead, it's taxed as its owners as a part of their taxed individual income. So if you have one person operating the LLC, you file as a sole proprietorship. If there is more than one owner, then the LLC is treated like a partnership. Note - you will have to file as an LLC in the state it's based in. Then you file for Federal EIN (in US you cant file without an EIN). Then you file to transact business in each state required, and must also pay taxes in each state that you operate business in.","If you work as an independent contractor, then you owe the government taxes in the state where you live. For many self-employed people, that just means paying their federal taxes and that's it. However, not everyone does that. Some states require you to pay them taxes. That's how New York gets non-residents to help pay for New York City's budget. New York City, and especially New York City and State, have a lot of state taxes for people living outside of New York. That means every state must make money off non-residents, but some states do it more than others. For self-employed people that only have customers in that state, they need to file a business return, and pay state tax on the income, and also have to pay any state taxes you owe as a resident (because that's what you are legally). LLCs are considered individuals, so the LLC itself just pays self employment tax on the income, but the members are still required to pay taxes on the income. There are additional rules if you have employees in that state. That's just the simple, cut and dry answer. In reality there are exceptions and special cases. I've had clients from California who were only in New York on work visas for a few months and didn't work enough to have an income. New York decided to get an income tax for the two months work that was only for the two months of work. I could go on, but I'm trying to avoid rambling. I think we answered your question. You owe state income tax on income you make in that state. If you are self employed, you owe this as the self employed portion of your business income. If you have employees, you have to deal with payroll taxes as well. If you need any more information, you should be able to find it with some more googling."
[INST] Intro to Investment options for a Canadian [/INST],"First, congrats on being debt-free. It's very difficult for 2 people to have such a goal and be successful with it. I don't know what your income is like, but I want to share some advice that I use and is based on my current status of financial independence and passive income. I recommend you begin reading up on index funds.  They are basically funds that invest in companies based on stock indexes.  So for example, some index funds are based off the S&P/TSX Composite Index, or the Morningstar US Market Index.  You just keep contributing every year or month or week, and the funds do the investing for you.  You can find them through mutual funds with the bank, or buy them yourself through a discount broker.  You need to read more about them to understand them. If you do some research about Canadian dividend paying stocks, you could also follow a portfolio strategy.  A good place to research this is the Canadian Couch Potato blog, where JoeTaxpayer shares his monthly update of his family investing portfolio.","The best investment for people with $0 debt and no dependents is to just invest directly in the stock market (not ETFs, but actual ownership of stocks). This requires you to: But if you're going to go through the trouble of learning about investing in the first place, why not learn about how to do it right, instead of learning how to pick losers? I'd recommend you read The Intelligent Investor. The last half of the book discusses directly how to pick stocks and the other half warns specifically against the types of traps many novices fall into."
[INST] Is 6% too high to trade stocks on margin? [/INST],"There are two factors to consider: What is the risk of the position when held short, i.e. on margin? In layman terms, how likely is your broker going to force closeout? Or, in other terms, how likely is the price to fall below the margin requirement? For example, in the last market crash many people had positions with their broker of 80% or 90% margin: it was their equity at risk that was 20% to 10%.  They were fine if the market went down or up for a while since even if one closed in a 50% loss the equity was only gone and they could get started again if the market came up, or they could wait a while (as long as the margin requirement was satisfied) for the 20% to come back if it didn't hit that threshold.  Some of their positions didn't move at all and the equity was growing and so they stayed there for months/years without any risk. Others were 80-85% margin and when we reached the 72 or 66 level, they had a margin call; some had an 18 months break to get it back up and some not (depending if it was a new or a rolling margin call and whether they owned the securities shorted). So, for margin trading it depends what you risk. To answer your specific question: If you want to be safe from that 6%, you should have: The 28% margin requirement for short positions.  This allows the price to decrease up to 28% without you getting a margin call and having your positions force closed out. Which means you need 50% equity to ensure your margin call kicks in only when you have breached 6%. And yes, that is a lot but it's because it is safe and it's an old rule that hasn't changed yet.  And the same rule applies worldwide for margin trading. That means that for short positions, 6% is perfectly safe for 28% margin.  And it remains true if you wish to be safe from margin calls in the next market fall.","You cannot know ""what"" you are paying unless you know exactly what the situation is in a given scenario. For example, your cost of financing would in addition to margin account interest rate also include additional charges incurred because the trading account might have a daily/daily/1/2 and a weekly fee that could be incurred on a given day if you did margin more than one day in a given week or a specific cost of carrying position in an exotic instrument. In addition to cost, one has to take into account how much cash is actually in the account as a net investment as it might appear you have $850K of investments but it also might be possible you owe $1 Million in financing and are negative $50K so if you withdraw the $850K then you might be actually withdrawing less cash as you might need to pay $50K to make a withdrawal of $850K. Therefore it would be critical as well to know the total value of cash and the collateral being used and if you withdrew any cash you might then have $2 Million in total debt but only $200K in cash available to satisfy the debt making your investment $1.8 Million which is 2/3 of the $2Million of debt. You could see the situation could quickly get out of control."
"[INST] Better ways to invest money held by my small, privately-held Canadian corporation? [/INST]","The simplest way to get a guaranteed income is to invest in bonds.  However, bond yields have been pretty low for quite some time.  Another option may be investing in dividend-paying stocks.  You don't need to own individual companies, you can invest in dividend ETF's.  In any event, I think the dividends should be greater than what you were asking for.  Also your question indicates a fairly large investment.  If the cost of investing is an issue, ETF's should be a good option for you.","A registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) is one way to invest your corporation's money that lets it grow tax-free until retirement. The problem is that you can't access the money without making yourself poor (RRSP's are tax-free until retirement, but if you take them out of an RRSP it's a taxable income and subject to penalties, which pretty much makes the RRSP idea pointless). One solution I have read of is a ""savings option"" within the RRSP -- essentially, it's like a TFSA in that you are allowed (if the RRSP manager offers it) to not deduct current year RRSP contributions. This allows you to let accumulation of money in the RRSP and earnings on that money grow tax free. You can either withdraw this money or keep it in the RRSP (thus allowing this accumulation to continue). Some people might be tempted to put the money into an investment that they think will grow and let it stay there for the future retirement of the current owner of the corporation. There's no issue with that for income tax (as long as it's an investment the corporation has a legitimate interest in), however in Canada, once the corporation starts to pay dividends/etc., then your taxation rate is the small business tax rate of 11-16.5% (depending on the province you live in) instead of the 22-29% income tax rate people who are not a corporation would pay. As well, the small business tax rate may not be ""permanent"", and be brought up to the personal tax rate in the next 6-8 years. Keep in mind though for income tax, I think you can sell a private company you don't want and that proceeds would be considered a ""capital gain"" and subject to the capital gains tax rates (lower than normal marginal rate), you might be able to sell the shares in a public company (through a broker) however, if the corporation has assets you might be forced to sell all or part of the assets to pay for the taxes (i.e., if you're not careful, your corporation could lose money and you could be stuck with bills to pay)."
[INST] Why do some symbols not have an Options chain for specific expiration dates? [/INST],"There are essentially 2 reasons: As you mentioned for some underlying the options market is not open for trading, for example for options with expiration less than 1 year. If you add expiration that is less than 1 year or less than the options market is open you will get a blank sheet. It means your options do not have ticker or symbol. The other way if you have different trading session in same country then also you could get a blank sheet. For example trading sessions starts at 9:30 AM and stops at 4 pm so for expiry from 3 o'clock you will be getting a blank (no ticker/symbol) sheet.","You are asking the wrong question.  When I want to sell an option before it expires I always check the ask price.  If it's not at least some percentage below the market price of the stock then there is no point in selling it.  I believe 75% of the market price is the typical price to aim for with the higher number being the better for your profit. You then look to see what the bid price is.  This is how much you can expect for the option if you hold on to it until it expires.  If the bid price is not at least some percentage above your cost to carry the option then you again have no reason to hold on to it until it expires. Finally you look at the volume traded price and the opening price.  If the volume traded price is still higher than the opening price then there is reason to believe that the current price at which it's trading is an intraday high.  If this is the case and you are holding on to a long term option and would like to sell it for some quick profit (or to reduce your current exposure), this is probably the best time to do it since it's unlikely that today will be the high for the day. If the volume was so large that it has dropped the price below both the market and the bid then you probably want to hold on to it.  There would be no reason to get out. If there is no volume whatsoever then there is no one buying or selling this option.  Maybe you want to put the offer price slightly ahead of the market price and wait until someone does place a buying order."
[INST] How can I pay for school to finish my degree when I can't get a student loan and have bad credit? [/INST],"Get your hands on as much cash as possible (this might mean selling what stuff and living on rice and beans, or possibly even working multiple jobs). Then go to http://www.salliemae.com/index/en/ and apply for a loan for your partner from there. With 2 incomes, you should be able to afford the payments. Make sure you know everything about the loans - do you pay interest on them now, on graduation, and is the interest rate fixed or floating? Also, what are the minimum payments? As for your credit, find out exactly what's causing the problem. Pull a report from all of the credit bureaus (they are required by law to give you one free report a year). Then, find out what is on the report, and call the creditors. Find out how long it will be before the items are no longer listed on your report. Pay any bills that are outstanding. If your bills are all current, figure out what's causing the problem. Are you paying your bills on time and they've incorrectly reported it, are they not reporting payments, are they reporting late payments? This is the only way to figure it out. Once you know why your credit is bad, and what's on the report, figure out a way to increase your income. Saving is also very, very important (this is actually what a lot of people don't do) because with the student debt, and the other factors, if you ever lose your job, you're going to have a very hard time paying your debt in the event that someone in your family needs the medical care that insurance doesn't cover, or in the event that you lose your vehicle (you'll need another one), if you ever need to move, or have to pay for your wedding (hopefully it's with someone with a good income), or have a child, you're suddenly in quite a different financial situation and a debt crisis will probably be the last thing on your mind and you'll find yourself in default and unable to pay anything. With an emergency fund it's possible that you'll have to use it, and in the event of a death, it's going to be very important that you have it.","The first thing you need is a good credit score. You really want to have a good credit score and have several lines of credit paying off each month.  Most schools will also have work-study programs and most people that work in the school have very good, or at least, average, credit scores. If you're a student, you may want to check out your college, and see if they have any of the following: work-study job, student loan repayment help, scholarship opportunities, campus financial aid programs, college assistance loans. If you are an international student, you still may have some options. First off, if you're not here on a work visa, you don't qualify for any federal aid. You can try to search for online student loan programs, or maybe have your parents apply for a financial aid loan through the government. In order to be a full time worker in the US, you have to be 21 years old and be able to prove residency for a certain period of time. You will probably have to go through any number of background checks. So you need a good credit history, and you need steady employment, to build a credit history. So what you can do in order to build your credit: get a bank account and make on-time payments on it, get a charge card or a credit card (one of these, depending on your banking history), and make on-time payments on this credit card or charge card, buy things that you wouldn't otherwise buy, and pay small interest rates on loans that you're paying off (such as a student loan), avoid buying on credit (credit card shopping) because you're not getting good interest rates on those, and, finally, you need to take into consideration your banking history, which, depending on how long you've been here, and the bank, you might still have money available to take out on a bank loan, but, depending on your citizenship status, you may not qualify for an interest free bank loan (and if you do, then you obviously just pay the low rate on the loan). So hopefully, with these simple steps and a bit of patience, you should be able to get through college in no time."
[INST] Does a company's stock price give any indication to or affect their revenue? [/INST],"The price represents what investors think the future earning of the company will be discounted by the growth rate of the company.  Note that in your title, you ask the price to affect revenue, but the reverse actually occurs.","A company's stock price only indicates the market's perception of the company's value at a given time, which will (in the case of a successful operating company) correspond somewhat to the company's revenue. If you look at revenue, you will probably see a fairly predictable seasonal pattern, with the bulk of revenue coming later in the fiscal year; thus, it's no surprise that, in general, a company's stock tends to go up over the course of the fiscal year; if revenues were expected to be low, the stock price might drop before the end of the year, which would be a good time to dump stock you no longer wanted to keep. (If you get nervous about this, look up something called Value Seasoning). The stock prices also will generally move a little up or down based on a number of things besides the revenues: if the firm's debt/equity ratio (the relationship between how much credit they got from the bank to purchase machinery or equipment, and how much is owned by shareholders like you or me) is too high, you'll see the price drop; if the firm's earning are very low relative to the market average, the price will generally fall. (If a company's earning are high, but a competitor also has high earnings, the price may even rise; e.g. Coke and Pepsi - that's a tough call for the analyst - but if Coke's earnings are low relative to the market, the price will drop). Stock prices are also affected by news (i.e. the company released a new flavor of soda, or a recall) that may affect either good news (higher revenues expected), or bad news (decreased revenues) in the future; sometimes analysts may discount that information, which is another reason for the price of a company's stock to rise or fall.  If this is all very nebulous, here's another way to try to put it: say you own shares in a particular company. You hold on to your shares, you sell them to someone else. The price you can sell the shares for will either go up or down depending on how the analysts perceive the company's future revenues, as well as how the company's current revenue stacks up relative to other companies in the same industry. Hope this sheds some light on how this all works."
[INST] Are there statistics showing percentage of online brokerage customers that are actually making a profit trading forex/futures/options? [/INST],"In my experience, a lot of people buy into the idea that they can make a lot of money in the financial markets and so they start trading stocks, futures, forex, options, etc.  But they don't take a second to educate themselves on the risks or realities of the financial markets. Yes, there are lots of people that make money in the markets, but the percentage of people that actually make money in the markets is quite small.  I feel sorry for the people that put time and money into making this their career only to realize they could have made more money by becoming a teacher.   They probably won't realize that though because they'll be too busy buying software, hardware, online data feeds and other gadgets to make them trade better.    The problem seems to be that when people buy in to the ""easy"" aspects of making money in the financial markets, they forget about the part that makes it a hard thing to do.  To make money in the financial market you need to know about financial markets and the way they work so that you can develop an appropriate trading system to execute your investment strategy.  The problem is people don't want to learn what they need to know about the financial markets and the way it works so they buy software.  But most of the trading software they buy doesn't work and the few programs that might be good often require some pretty heavy customization.  So buying software to trade the financial markets is more a way to waste time and money than it is a way to make money. People use indicators and other software on charts and believe that this is how to make money in the market.  But the problem with that approach is that most indicators and other charting software give you a view of the past and so you have to look for patterns to give you a view of the future.  There are lots of problems with this approach.  So instead of buying trading software and trying to guess what the market will do next, I would recommend finding a way to use the information on past markets to make better trades more often.  It doesn't matter if it is a new way to use statistics from the markets or a new way to use software, the important part is that you find a way to make better trades more often.  There are tons of people out there saying you can make money in the markets, make millions trading from home, trade with little effort from your own computer, bla... bla... bla... bla... bla... bla... And, unfortunately, there are many people out there taking them at their word.  They buy their software/sign up for their newsletter so that they can copy a stock picking or trading system that made this person millions.  But instead of making millions they lose their life savings.  Then they complain that the stock picking service didn't work or that they ""made too much money"" on a trade and the service told them to get out.  This guy can have a very good way to pick profitable stocks but he tells you to buy a penny stock which drops the next trade... and now you're down $15K when he's up 8K.  No one can guarantee you will make money trading the markets.  So, instead of chasing the money, realize that it takes time to educate yourself so that your chances of making a profit increase substantially.   To be honest, I would recommend that people that want a high probability of making a profit first learn enough about the markets so that that they can invest directly in an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) rather than try and find a way to make a profit trading financial markets.  Then they can use any excess profits to try and make a few trades on their own.","In this video, an interview with J. Paul Getty, he says something that applies to all investing and all trading: Most investors think it is how to get out, not how to get in. This is true. But as investors we should not have the end goal in sight. When you open the position, get rid of the objective to be stopped out. Be flexible as it moves; in fact let it move to whatever price it needs to to get out of the market. You can then look for the next opportunity. As traders, we need to take the information from the past and incorporate that into the plan of attack going forward. However, if you can't let go of that goal (which most people can't), the best thing I can suggest from our discussion in our conversation is to take your position size, and for every 1% movement in the favor of the market, you have an equal position sized stop loss at the opposite direction. For example, if a trader is looking to buy 10 lots of gold, he would open the first 5 lots and create a 30 pip stop loss at $1415.10 (or, 2.0% below the market price). If at any moment the price moves below there, he gets out. When the price moves to a level he is comfortable with buying those shares (or he would be at a loss of 30 pips and wants to buy more), he would place the next 5 points at a level that would protect him on a further drop (such as 2% out from the new market high). When he gets there, he would then place the next 5 point stop loss, and so on. This would stop you from taking large losses and potentially get you a series of small profits. Or, if you take your position size and instead of 30 pips you only take it to a level that would be 2% or closer on the reverse side of the trend. This methodology would create an environment where you either make some profits (or break even), and in the short term would create less losses than you might otherwise. It wouldn't stop you from taking more losses than you may take currently (a person that takes 5 losses in a row should be stopped from trading), but I would suggest it will give you better results both in terms of profits but most importantly, in terms of minimizing your losses."
[INST] How should I allocate short-term assets in a rising-interest rate environment? [/INST],"This is what I would do: Put half of your money in short-term bonds now.  A good choice is a portfolio of bonds or bond mutual funds.   Short-term bond funds are good, but for the following reasons, I have chosen the next strategy: The second choice is to invest some in a bond fund, and some in Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). With this second option you must invest in a mutual fund or ETF which includes TIPS, or one which is specifically a TIP bond fund.  There are now also companies issuing TIPs, like Vanguard now offers one VEU.  Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. These bonds are tied to inflation measures.  The interest on them is taxed as ordinary income and the principle invested in them is tax-free when redeemed. To see the different choices available go to Vanguard, click on the link to mutual funds and type ""inflation"" in the search window.  This will turn up several funds which you can read about. My opinion on what bonds to choose: TIPS - You can either pick the one which has the ""shortest"" call periods. Or the lowest yields, which means a higher risk to prices.  I would opt for a shortest call period rather than going for highest yield.  This provides the best protection.  Or if the company's TIPS are not acceptable you can pick one of the others listed in the above Vanguard suggestion. Or if you think the TIPS market is overvalued you could chose an investment grade corporate bond fund.  The longer bond has the worst inflation and most inflation risk of all bonds since rates may go up. Some people may advise investing the money in an equity or growth mutual fund.  If you can find a well-managed growth mutual fund that is a good choice.  However, due to the risk of volatility, I would do this with less than half the balance of your money. I think short-term bonds, and perhaps TIPS are your best bet.","To say a bond is a bad investment because of the effects of inflation isn't really true. Bonds can only be seen as a bad investment if you hold them to maturity. If you choose to buy a bond during times of rising interest rates when a bond has low earnings compared to the prevailing market interest rates, you might lose money if you choose to hold on to the bond because it might be redeemed for only its principal value if interest rates go up.  If you however are able to hold a bond to maturity and then buy new bonds of the next generation, you could profit from the increase in the principal of the bond as it approaches maturity and also profit from a lower rate, if rates continue going up.  This can be very well stated in this question.  What I would do to make money in this situation is a bit different than the answer given here.  The yield that a bond makes is determined based on how a bond is priced which is based off of it's principal value.  The principal value is the amount you will receive when the bond matures.  If bonds become less preferred in the market and interest rates drop, then the principal value of that bond increases (i.e. the amount you receive when the bond matures).  A bond that has a higher principal value can also be exchanged for a bond that has a lower principal value with bond.  You will receive more for the amount you originally gave for the higher value bond than the lower value bond.  This means that if you want to buy a long term bond, then you probably do not want to buy it when the principal value is high, but when it is a low principal value at which it has a low yield.  The yield will increase as the principal value increases so you can sell the bond later at this point and profit on higher yields.  If you buy a bond that has a low principal value and the principal value of that bond increases, then you can also sell that bond (or exchange it) for a bond with a much higher principal value, meaning that you just made money by the same value.   Inflation can create a lot of volatility and there are ways to work around this using derivatives which can even work to profit on this volatility."
[INST] Pros/cons of borrowing money using a mortgage loan and investing it in a low-fee index fund? [/INST],"If you live in the UK, you can borrow with a lifetime ISA. See https://www.tax.gov.uk/businesses/individuals/life-time-isa/how-lifetime-isa-works/","Well, the biggest risk would be in timing. You could put a bunch of money in the fund and then the market falls. If you need to sell, you'll be out at the bottom. This will of course happen, at times, and the only thing you could do would be to diversify in a way that you don't lose quite as much in the downturn (maybe you go up a risk level). I actually don't think that timing is the biggest risk to worry about though -- there are a lot of other risks that you have to consider before making decisions about diversifying your funds. That would include: Taxes; your risk level; your time horizon; your age; whether you are maxing out on any retirement plans where your employer matches your contributions (you would not want to miss out on those!); your overall goals, and what they are in terms of time, risk, and retirement plans; your own investment philosophy. There are a lot more to consider here -- I just picked a few as examples."
[INST] Freelancer in India working for Swiss Company [/INST],"There are a three main issues for which you should be aware: The easiest and fastest way to get money from abroad into your account would be to sign up with one of the many foreign exchange companies, transfer money in from your account here to your account and get paid either there (and they transfer it to your account for you) or at least have them transfer it to your account locally.  Note that there may be transfer fees, so check before hand. The big benefit here is speed - a day or so depending on the company, while a traditional bank transfer would take weeks to start moving and even longer to go through.  They do charge the market conversion prices, so you'd probably make a few less rupees per franc than the official official, official rate, but the fees and waiting is probably makes up for it. In general, working for the Swiss company from India is going to make things more complex and less cheap because of all of the tax things, but this will mean that some of these fees will be tax-deductible so this will save you money in the end. This doesn't mean that you won't need to pay taxes to the Swiss government. If you're doing this often, I'd seriously recommend hiring an accountant / professional tax adviser who'll help you to ensure that you're filling out the right forms, filling them out correctly, and paying everything that needs to be paid. If you're freelancing, it's going to become increasingly difficult and time-consuming, with all of the paperwork, to keep track of all of it, so do yourself a favour and get the expert help. In theory you don't have to pay import tax in India if you're an entrepreneur / small business and they classify what you're bringing in as equipment, but in practice it's probably going to need some hand-wavy convincing on their part. As an alternative to just importing them directly from Syscom in Switzerland, you might want to order them from a site like NewEgg. This way you avoid the whole business of customs and shipping them directly to India. The only problem that could arise is that the warranty may be regionalised, so any support, etc. requests may not get far. I have no real experience with India business / tax regulations, nor have I researched them, so take this as unofficial advice. If you are looking for some official advice regarding your questions  (or if this advice is wrong because of some crazy laws) then you should probably contact someone in the know who will give you the best advice possible given your circumstances.",You'll be paying both Federal and State taxes as a resident of US. I'm going to suggest you to pay taxes from India as a Non Resident (NRI) as you have stayed for less than 2 years in America. You can take that money to India and pay taxes here. This way you'll pay tax only in your current place of residence (India). In other words whatever India taxes you'll pay taxes you'll pay.
[INST] Difference between Edward Jones or Betterment [/INST],"Both are companies, right? They have employees. How should I pick? Which should I take care of more? Edward Jones or Betterment.  Why pay two companies?  Can you not be the ""company""?  In other words, how can you not manage your own personal finances?","If you're trying to get into the market using a financial advisor instead of robo-advisor the main difference will be how much you pay.  Both, however, come with their perils. Robos Robos are much less expensive than going through a financial advisor.  The most popular robo-advisers are Betterment, Wealthfront, Personal Capital, and FutureAdvisor, each offering free portfolio management and minimal account fees (typically around 0.25% annually). However, these financial advisers do not have the CFP certification and are essentially online interfaces with computers making trades for you.  They offer you a questionnaire or automated investment suggestions based on your risk tolerance. I highly recommend you read this previous post on robo-advisers to better understand how they work, and the risks and benefits (or lack thereof) of using robo-advisors. If you choose to go with a robo-adviser, then choose the one that best suits you with the fewest fees/costs. Financials advisors If you decide to use an actual financial advisor, make sure to check any and all fees that you may be charged. I also suggest that you read this post if you choose to go through a financial advisor to better understand the risks associated. Make sure that your advisor doesn't push you into investing in something you don't want to invest in (e.g., life insurance policies, etc), as they are most likely affiliated with a commission-based insurance agent. Financial advisors can be found by word-of-mouth, by asking friends/family if they can recommend anyone they use regularly; just make sure that they are CFPs and not insurance agents, as insurance agents are also considered financial advisors, and often have a different agenda (e.g. trying to sell you a whole-life insurance policy in addition to managing your investments). You're also better off going to a bigger financial advisory firm (e.g., Edward Jones, Morgan Stanley), then a 1 or 2-person shop where you could be a small (and very profitable) client for them."
[INST] Why do UK banks require monthly “pay in” into current account? [/INST],"They require a monthly payment ""in to your current account"" (by direct debit, Faster Payments etc.) and also that the direct debit payment must be ""standing"". You should have no trouble with this as you simply set up a direct debit from your account, using a regular monthly debit on your debit card to pay your existing broadband and TV services.",When you use an account to pay your bills it does not mean you have money in there. For example a company might pay you and expect you to transfer this money to your bank account which you then use to pay your bills out of. This is in effect a loan. If one of your direct debits gets declined because you ran out of money in your account they can try to over draw the same account and that will get declined as you do not have enough in the account. You then have to borrow or go to a payday lender.
[INST] Why invest in IRA while a low-cost index fund is much simpler? [/INST],"You said you do not need to put money away for retirement. Then you said you do need to put some money away. If you need to put some money away, don't overdo it. A couple of thousand a year is a lot better than no money at all. It doesn't take much to get the benefit of the contributions, so as you were saving, just take another small amount out of your expenses for a 401K or a Roth. It doesn't have to be the maximum allowable just something. 30 years of compounded growth and not taking out your money now, then retiring as planned, will make you a millionaire, I'm pretty sure of it, though I'd like to know your age. As to why you would recommend one vehicle over the other, there are many reasons, but I'll start with the fact that a Roth IRA or 401K allows deductions up to retirement and taxes on withdrawals. In other words while you are young you're paying taxes on your 401k contributions (if you're in the US). By adding to your IRA with Roth contributions, you're paying tax now at your current rate, and when you withdraw them in retirement, the IRS will have no idea what rate you were at, so you can pull it out tax free. When you're older, however, you have two big advantages. If the value of stock and bonds is high in comparison to income, you probably won't have to pay taxes due to a good deal of retirement income. Even if you do, the amount is probably going to be a lot less than when you made the contributions in the first place, allowing for a decent return even if it's just breaking even due to the compounded interest.","The IRA (and to a lesser degree 401k's) is a legal structure that will allow your investments to grow tax free, or tax deferred. Any dollar invested today and allowed to accumulate is 3X the contribution in today's money.  That's a 60% real return.  This compounds for as long as you hold the money.  It is not a small benefit to delay paying taxes especially if you invest into low tax-rate savings accounts. When the government is broke, then it can and will increase all taxes.  You have your entire future covered with no changes in money (unless inflation gets it).  Any contributions on top of the IRA will not be taxed until you take them, which is likely in your lower earning years when you need to supplement on your retirement income. Your current money is taxed today when you take it out.  Your growth may double or triple with tax advantaged accounts. A single contribution of $5000 at 22 and a consistent dividend of $1500 per year for 78 years into T.Row Price 5 year CD will return roughly, with inflation, $1M.  Or about 11 times your original investment of $23k including capital gains and dividends.   To be clear, there is no investment that will provide a 20+% return year over year.  You will be in the top 1% of earnings in your age bracket consistently.  This is why you should have multiple retirement accounts. If you have a 401k, contribute the maximum to that and the ROTH, or the SEP, or the traditional IRA.  Any combination of those will make you a super saver of retirement income.  It also will allow you to make withdrawals during 2002-2018 because of the current market conditions."
[INST] Am I considered in debt if I pay a mortgage? [/INST],"Let me see what this works out to. Mortgage debt at the time of purchase is 130% of the property value.  20 years later, 130% of a 20 year loan is 126% of the property value, or the mortgage. A 20 year mortgage does not reduce the debt, it merely transfers the debt from the seller to you. You borrow the money to buy a property, and at the end of the term you will still owe 100% of the original borrowed amount. In other words, the bank loaned you money so that you could purchase the property. If you need money you should consider getting the bank loan anyway and using it for the down payment. Don't ask the bank to loan you money, purchase an expensive house and ask them to give you one of their lenders for the rest. That's not a house down payment. You will need to come up with enough money to pay for the house. If you can't do that maybe you need to look at a less expensive house, or you can try to borrow the rest from a 2nd or 3rd mortgage. Either way be aware that your monthly mortgage payment will include the mortgage and the 2nd mortgage, so you'll pay more then on your current mortgage.","""debt"" or ""borrowed money"" doesn't usually refer to a mortgage. Debt includes your credit card, student loan, car loans and other such things. These are all forms of borrowed money, but if you are underwater with your mortgage you aren't borrowing, just paying off the debt.  Most mortgage companies are happy to offer a refinance to get a lower rate so you can either lower your payments or reduce the length of term.  Of course the ""debt"" will be the difference between the equity amount and the new mortgage balance. If the bank/company doesn't offer debt refinance, then just pay them off as you get the money!"
[INST] How can I spend less? [/INST],"Here are some ideas that I have put into practice: When you know you're going to be buying something, figure out how soon you could get it. It's harder to think about the money when it's delayed. The classic example is an airline ticket. ""Well no one knows how much cheaper it will be in 2 weeks, maybe it'll get much cheaper and I'll just wait."" Then when 2 weeks end you say to your boyfriend ""We could make it to that city if we fly on XYZ airlines for less than $200!"" It's also just as cheap to fly tomorrow (but then you have to pay the $500 because that's cheaper than the alternative and you need to fly in less than a week). It also applies to things on sale - are you going to save that much more money if you wait two weeks? If this is a habit then you might want to think about it deeper, are you waiting for something good to come along or are you worried about making a decision? If it is a worry about spending money you will regret the decision, then maybe you are spending money to feel safe. For example, you can buy a cheap book or you can pay twice as much to avoid the possibility of a book coming out that you want to read. I am the type of person that will buy the expensive book rather than take the chance that I'll find another book.","I don't know about your work, but I've often heard that it's easier to save (for example, retirement savings) when you start as early as possible.  I suggest you ask yourself what you plan to save for in the future.  Then, figure out each month how much you need save for that.  Include in that figure a little to cover expenses (because they could change or unexpected expenses may occur). Figure out what you have left with after saving and decide what you might make cutbacks on to make up any difference.  It's a very personal decision as one person might need to cut their clothing spending and another might need to cut down on trips to the gym.  It's important to be realistic in your goals while being realistic on what you can afford to cut."
"[INST] Which market orders to meet this recommendation : 'Take a position on the purchase of the fooBar share, protect your capital by placing a stop' [/INST]","No, the correct interpretation is not ""Buy x shares at $xx.xx"", the buy stop does not act as take-profit and the two are not the same.  The buy stop is not a buy limit. The buy stop will trigger at the buy stop price, and immediately place a buy limit right at that price. The first buy triggering the buy stop would place the limit buy order; later triggers will not add additional buy orders. The stop is a stop loss at the position price, if the stop loss triggers then the buy limit is cancelled.","As I see it there are several issues with following the advice word-for-word.   First, if you're going long (buy first), you need the bid to increase.  If you're placing the orders in the correct order, the ask will take precedence, giving you less money for the trade (less money, but more shares, which I'm assuming is the desired effect).  The trade-off would be if the market moved sideways or down.  You're giving up money by going with the bid and protecting your capital. If you're going short (sell first), you need the ask to increase.   If you're trading more than a few shares and the market starts moving in the direction of the trade, you could get hit with a gap against your stop-loss order and see an unplanned loss.  This might be mitigated if you were using a trailing stop.   My advice would then be to place the buy/sell and trailing stop at the same time as each other using the open/high of the last candlestick, just so you guarantee yourself the same fill price for both sides of the trade.   At least for me, when you place a stop order on its own and just as a limit order at the specified price, it would go back to the market book and try to match against other limit orders rather than your open/close. This of course would then increase the potential slippage in your trades.   For the most part, I don't see the stop-limit recommendation as useful.  It doesn't protect you from adverse price moves, and the time and slippage in adding the stop (especially without any volume to back up the order) could turn a positive trade into a negative one."
[INST] give free budgeting advice [/INST],"Budgeting can save you thousands of dollars over the course of a year. You can save money in many ways -- starting with creating a budget. Some tips: Use one credit card, but pay it off every month (or week) to earn good rewards or build credit -- but make sure you don't go over the credit limit! This can hurt your credit score, and cause you to pay fees. Do not use debit cards -- it is not the same as spending money you already have in the bank, if you go over the balance, you can get an overdraft fee -- and over time these can add up to more than all of your other fees combined. Use a combination of bank accounts, and credit union savings account, and put as little as 10% of your paycheck into an account where you cannot access it except through the online banking interface. This forces you to save money when you need a new car or house or other expensive item. Take money with you in cash to work -- just in case you are not near an ATM -- if nothing else, this will stop you from spending money you don't already have on the way to work! Don't spend what you don't have -- meaning, keep your credit card(s) and debit card(s) closed, until you are certain the money's been deposited. Use automatic paycheck deposits (or automatic monthly withdrawls into an account) so you know not to spend money you ""just don't have"". For instance, make sure your mortgage / mortgage insurance payment gets taken out of your checking account. Do NOT use paper checks -- they are expensive, and easily forgotten about. Use direct deposit, or automatic withdrawl (especially for debt you owe to credit card companies). Pay your bills when they are due -- and when your budget was made. Banks and utilities do not like late payments. Get an online budgeting app or program -- they will not only track your money (if you tell them to), they will help you organize your bills and remind you when debts are due. Many of them can be synchronized with the web or an iPhone/Android app -- so you never lose your data if you have a computer failure, and you can do it all right on your phone! There are lots of them right on the market today... Here's a few: Mint, Mvelopes, Wave, GoodBudget, PocketSmith.","Create a budget. Set a plan, determine what your income is and create a budget. You said you're a student, so I'm going to assume you just have a regular job rather than some sort of a scholarship. If you're doing your own books, I recommend Quickbooks. It's a cloud based solution that allows you to setup the budget. You can then track every expense against the budget and you'll easily know if you've blown it. You can signup at Quickbooks Online where the first month is free, or you can signup for the Mac or PC desktop version, which will only cost you $15 per month (if you need to). Budgeting is one aspect of financial planning; the other major part is where you invest your money and plan your retirement. The next thing I'd recommend is you start reading money pages/blogs/resources such as MoneyChimp  and Get Rich Slowly. The first will help you understand finance, investments, and the basics of how money works in everyday terms. The second will guide you through a number of budgeting exercises that will help you understand where you're blowing it. Once you understand your spending habits, you develop strategies to rein in the over spending. You don't want to be too frugal for once you're used to the money, it will be tough to give it up when you start earning more/make more money."
[INST] Executing a stop loss at the purchase price? [/INST],"Generally, you don't get to set the price that is bought back at when you open the position. When the position is opened, a market order is placed that is filled by your broker at the best available market price. That market price changes very rapidly at times. However, generally, buy prices are increasing at the time the position is opened and therefore it is logical that your stop loss order would be at a lower price than the purchase price. Otherwise, it seems like a guaranteed profit. That said, there is often a small price difference between the market price, used to open the position, and the stop loss price, if a stop loss is used. This difference is usually called the spread. Therefore, in some situations, a market order might be used to place the stop loss order, especially since the stop loss price has a high priority.","I have been using Interactive Brokers for a couple of years now and just recently executed a stop loss at the break-even price.  I can now close all positions at break-even price (and lower) which is a function in IB.  A trade can be a very volatile one and may run up to $10/20 a share in very heavy or liquid stocks such as VL (VALE) and LLY in a matter of minutes.  IB TWS software lets you limit the order to the stop price and not higher.  You could place an order on the ask price ($136.50) but the stop loss may execute at a higher price than the stop price ($137.20 in this example). To confirm the order details hover over the order and check the price box as well as the ""Limit"" button next to the quantity box (or price in the order text area) if you enter a percentage as your stop price and price in the order box is your ask price. The IB software allows your portfolio value to go negative as well as positive. So long as you pay the amount you want to keep on the account."
[INST] Pros/cons of borrowing money using a mortgage loan and investing it in a low-fee index fund? [/INST],"Well, there are good reasons why you SHOULDN'T use debt to attempt to improve your ROI.  Generally you'll earn less on your portfolio during a bear market.  Will you pull more of that money out to pay the debt during such a market?  Will the investment go up quickly enough that you'll be able to pay it all back?  Is the return of the market a good enough risk vs return ratio to do this?  The market may go up 1% in a year.  If you can't get a lower interest rate than .01% annual return, it wasn't a good plan.  The main problem you're ignoring is what happens if there isn't a good market when you get a good paycheck and your monthly income isn't enough to pay the debt.  Are you selling an investment that's worth more than the debt due right then, or worse, would you need to pay the debt out of pocket?  Or will you need to pay more on the debt from other sources of income. A second issue is fees associated with doing this.  The interest and possibly early transfer fees to buy shares of an index fund will outweigh the lower expense fees of investing in your 401K/retirement savings plan at work. Or if you're taking money from a 401K, inadvisable use of tax penalty money.  I don't understand why you'd buy stock and then buy more later, or why you'd sell stock when it was going down then repurchase if market went back up, that is effectively day trading, maybe?  I'd simply suggest not to make this kind of long term investment decision out of impulsiveness or emotion.  If you have a good emergency fund that can go from $7K to $16K easily a year and pay that debt before it balloons into a bigger debt, then maybe so.  I'd rather be in debt than losing money.  There's no risk in that and you can always pay out more if you need or want to later.","One important part of the analysis:  how much interest are you paying?  And what is an appropriate rate of inflation to use (10 years out you probably assume 5.5%, but with low rates now, you might get 7-8%).   Secondly, how much money are you starting with to invest and how much will you need to take out during retirement? (There will be a large amount of 'required' money; 1 to 2 times the amount of money you pay into it if you start now.)"
[INST] Why are Rausch Coleman houses so cheap? Is it because they don't have gas? [/INST],"The reason why the costs of gas are significantly cheaper than other areas in Texas and surrounding states is because it is so close to many major natural gas providers.  One of the reasons why other markets (including Houston) do not see drastic increases in the cost from gas is because in order to get it to a large market you have to lay down an infrastructure pipeline which is very expensive to build.  For that reason, if you plan on staying in this area it is not so much of a factor that you need to consider when looking for a house, since the cost from gas is never going to change from what it currently is unless you move out of the state.  You need to consider the other factors, including how much do you need to pay property tax, how much is the utility bill, among others that might cost you more in the short term because there is only so much you can do with price in the long term.","There are always less than good reasons to buy from any specific builder. You have a lot of choices in Austin, in the 150k-250 range. All of them build in your subdivision.  Rausch Coleman is part of a group (Gerding Edlen) that owns all of Austin's high rises you see if you are near the Downtown and UT areas, they also have homes and condos for sale in the Lake Travis area. You can look up Gerding Edlen's list of properties on their website.  But let's just say that all builders have one similar thing in common, they offer different designs to save money. To keep costs low on the base model, you will be forced into a lot of things that have cost cutting ideas in order to make that price work in your budget, such as ""cheap"" kitchen countertop, vinyl floors, carpet that does not last as long as more expensive floor coverings. Then as you go up in the upgrades you get to choose from a much wider range of choices, and for the builder, many times the price is pretty small for what you are getting.  With Rausch Coleman, the base model starts at 159K, but the real question is do you really only need 159K to build a house? For the extra 20k or so that they go up to, you get about 600SF more. The base model is just a way to get you in the door. You really are only buying the land itself. It is when you get into the extras that you have choices. I recommend talking to one of their salespeople in person, or go visit some of your competition. Take a look and really compare the specifics of each house. Take some notes on what you like and don't like. Make a short list and then talk to the builder of choice, I am sure they won't mind your little competition list, and just maybe you will get a better price. When you are done, you can decide which house to build.  I hope I did not give too much of a sales pitch and this helps you make a more informed decision. Good luck."
[INST] What are frontier markets? Is investing in them a good idea? [/INST],"There are several issues to consider here. First would be what is ""frontier."" Second are you looking for a good, or great idea? Then there is ""investing"" in the market, what asset class? Let's deal with the first one: Frontier markets is a term that was coined for capital markets that are somewhere between emerging markets and developed markets. As Wikipedia notes: The term ""frontier markets"" was coined by Peter Fritsch and Jason Hsu at the New York-based Research Affiliates in 2007. Fritsch and Hsu define frontier markets as having a small capitalisation and being an emerging market.[4] They chose the term ""frontier market"" over the term emerging market as the latter term is more broadly used to characterise markets in transition from centrally planned economies to market economies. Hence, ""frontier"" is a more focused characterisation as it highlights that the market is a market economy. This implies that frontier markets have very small capitalization, i.e. they include small companies, or small countries, or small markets. The market cap of stocks will be less than 8 billion U.S. dollars according to Wikipedia. That's pretty tiny.  So, now you are in a new investment universe, investing in small firms in emerging markets. That's a new risk and reward universe. Does it make sense for you? What about looking for a great idea: Another area to think about is do you want a great idea or a new idea? Most of the new ideas and great ideas in developed markets have a pretty good history to track them. If the idea is not new, you can look at the historical performance against other choices which reduces the risk. The down side is everyone else may not like that idea, and by investing you are moving money from another ""great idea"" into yours. If you buy a stock in an emerging market in a new idea, you may be the first investor, and hence the reward could be very large.   Investing in the capital markets: When do you start investing in stocks? As in the ""frontier"" markets are very small, so is the market capitalization. You may be buying a basket of stocks that are all listed across the capital markets. If the stock exchange is small, it's going to take a while to list your stock. You might be investing in a basket of stocks that have very low liquidity, and thus have a high price of entry. If everyone is waiting for the stock to become listed, then the price will be very high when you buy it.  As you are investing in a very small part of the economy, you may be impacting the entire market. This can become a problem for you because you might think you have a great idea, but everyone else will come to be aware of it. Then the market may be ineffective, and you will be buying in with a premium price. Why would anyone sell shares to you at the current price? This is the key challenge investors face in small or ""frontier"" capital markets.","The term frontier market has become a very general term, but it is also generally used to mean an emerging market that is less mature or less stable than some other emerging markets. So there isn't really any definition of it for one. It is pretty much just a buzz word but it applies to many places, namely Latin America (outside of the ""BRIC"" countries). So the question you should be asking is what makes the frontier markets good right now? What economic factors are causing the frontier markets to be growing, stable, or undervalued right now? And what kind of company is going to benefit? If you are thinking of trying to get in and hold on to it for a long run of time to wait out the maturing and growth phases, then remember that the frontier markets just aren't as mature as the big emerging markets, and are less stable (so are more of a long term risk). Investing in frontier markets can be a good idea, but it depends more on your goals and time horizon, along with where you can find the best values and greatest returns on investments for your risk profile. Some places to check out some examples could be Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Uruguay, or Paraguay. Many places in the Middle East could be included here, or African countries. These will definitely not all be frontier markets, but could fit into that category. In addition, most countries that are currently in the frontier market or emerging market category will eventually graduate to an established nation and no longer would be included."
[INST] Weekly budgets based on (a variable) monthly budget [/INST],"You're mixing some concepts that are independent of each other. The budget is the amount of money set aside for that purpose; the expense is the amount spent to cover said budget. If you know (or predict) the budget, then what you're interested in is to find the best predictor of the expense given that budget. For the budget, there is no particular pattern, but if you do have a good prediction of a large budget, you can look for a good predictor of expense for a large amount, and vice versa.  A general pattern for budget and expense is that you'll need more money for larger budgets, but in this case, what makes it interesting is that the predictors are similar for small and large amounts. If the predictor is poor for a large amount, and then the budget is increased, the predictor will become better. Another way of saying this is that spending is more correlated with past spending, and budget size with future budget (at any point in time, you have no idea what past trends mean, but the future is based on the past trends, so you know the current trend). It seems you're basing your results on some historical data, so you can look for a predictor that relates to that dataset. However, because you would have to increase the number of samples in the data to improve the statistics, you'd have to increase your sampling time (in this case monthly, which would increase the prediction period). To summarize: if you want to predict based on budget, then the patterns in the budget matter more, but your ""weekly"" spending. If you want to predict based on spending, then the patterns of spending matter more, and your ""monthly"" budget. If there is a relationship between monthly budget and weekly spending, the time range will be between monthly and weekly for optimal performance.","Assuming your monthly income is $1000 (and this number is only going to change if you get raises or promotions, and not because you take a leave of absence or go into a depression), then $1000 is $12,000 a year which is 50k a career.   If you're a contractor you may be able to negotiate 40+ hour weeks, which would also increase that figure.  If your salary is under $50k or more at the age of 21, something's wrong (in that case your employer will be paying way more than $12/hr to subsidize your $12,000 living expenses).  That said - 23% is about right, but I think it also includes paying on your student debt.  Is it?  I do agree that you're being overly cautious about saving.  I was able to save 15% from college until I bought a more-affordable house (400k with 100k down), which freed up 5.5%/yr of my income to take on renting two rooms to strangers, so I was able to maintain my emergency savings while doubling my retirement savings without touching retirement money.   So yes, save for retirement, for your mortgage/car/children debt, for living expenses (ie - rent) and for your current discretionary spending.  Your goal is to keep all that going up, your discretionary spending should go up with your paycheck and your rental income should go up (unless your costs are higher than your income in which case you'll have to cut back) until you hit your retirement goal (with inflation, retirement could be 100k/yr - with SS being half that) and your fixed costs come down and you're living debt free without any money coming in (which is retirement but without the debt/mortgage)."
[INST] How does a public company turn shares into cash? [/INST],"Typically, it's not the responsibility of the corporation to liquidate the equity. Shares trade on markets at the hands of investment banks. They are the ones who determine what price the shares trade at. The company only needs cash when it has a reason to spend it. For example, to pay dividends or to repurchase shares, both of which are discretionary, not necessary activities. If the company doesn't want to spend the cash, it can save it and reinvest to fund its own growth. Thus there's nothing a corporation does to turn the value from the paper ownership of the company to cold hard cash. Its investors who buy and sell those shares do it, as a result, the companies market capitalization rises and falls.","In brief; A holding company, like many stock and bond issuers, has a number of subsidiary companies, each doing one or another business. A company can be a holding company because it has no real activity, but because it is the legal owner of other companies. A holding company typically does not have the activity but some (many?) companies use the holding company (group) as a legal separation of their different activities, as for example in case they don't want to cross-contaminate their businesses. That might be the case if you have a company that is active in nuclear energy, but have subsidiaries in gas and solar energy in one holding, or a gas company that may have subsidiaries for gas production and gas transportation. There is an argument you could make to argue that ""a holding company typically does not have the activity"", but then why bother to make the formal distinction at some point between holding- and subsidiary companies?  Because as companies become ever larger, it becomes more and more complicated to organise them legally, and at some point it's easier to ""put them in a box and give them a different name"". And if you do that, why not give them some different functions. But the distinction is there - and it's often difficult to even work out which companies are subsidiaried to which holding company. When I use the word activity here, that's not limited to ""turning a profit"" but anything that is useful for a company to do, such as the above examples: producing gas, transporting natural gas, or producing nuclear energy. It's not as if you should be afraid of a nuclear holding company because they won't know what to do with nuclear energy. In a broad way: the bigger the corporation, the bigger the management required and the more complex it sometimes becomes to make decisions and direct resources to make the appropriate progress. A holding company is sometimes just a legal entity as a consequence because there's no real ""other"". It just keeps the different companies together. The other option is to give the holding company some distinct function, for example in insurance companies I've seen holding companies that do nothing but insure other parts of the insurance group.  Why do people often speak about holding companies as if they're an investment? The best answer I can find is that a holding company is a good investment if your goal is to invest in the overall business of the company's holding. It gives you protection (and leverage) in case of bankruptcy of the group, since the holding company owns a percentage of shares in each of the subsidiaries. You could still lose your investment because of bankruptcy, but you'd then lose a chunk of the holding company rather than all of it at once. (For example; if you had 80% of the holding company's shares, bankruptcy of one subsidiary would take 80% of the holding company's value, and you'd lose 80% of your investment, rather than if you had invested in each subsidiary directly, you would lose 100% of each subsidiary's value. Or some percentage that equals the holding's stake in that subsidiary.)"
[INST] Brent crude vs. USD market value [/INST],"Why do prices of individual crude oil seem to be related, but not directly proportional, relative to the changes in volume of US dollars? If I am understanding this correctly, the price in dollars is not equal and the price in pounds and dollar seem to be related on the ""change in dollar"". This is because of the foreign exchange rate and you are mixing the foreign exchange rates between dollars and pounds is not equal (which is good because every country's currency fluctuates based on supply and demand by country. That is why the market value of USD crude oil is not the same as AUD oil, which is different from Brent oil). Oil trading is done in USD so if you are saying: 1000 barrels of Brent oil for 1000 euros right now, tomorrow there is less demand for oil, the price will drop and will be cheaper in pound, but most likely cheaper in dollars, since it is now priced in USD. You don't need to compare both, the value of USD is what makes Brent cheaper, and is it was not in dollars you would compare it against USD in dollars and viceversa.","I looked at your data and you can get a bit of information from it.  Brent crude is priced ""light sweets"": it is the price for sweet, light crude oil which is refined into gasoline.  It is the crude oil price for oil that is refined in Europe.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is a bit of a misnomer because it is actually traded in Cushing, OK, and is the price for sweet, light crude oil refined in the US.  The price for crude sold around the world is set by Brent crude.  WTI is the ""world market price"", which refers to the average price that oil sells for as a whole.  145.67 is Brent crude oil, as you said, from Aug 12, 2011 and 145.69 is WTI from aug 12, 2011.  So the actual crude oil price is not all that different, just the price that you are looking at.  And that is what the WTI is, the price of crude oil around the world.  So it does not have the price fluctuations of the dollar, but actually the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro.  So by simply looking at the exchange rate between USD and EUR, you can have a pretty strong indicator of what price oil is being sold at.   15.86 is USD for Aug 12, 2011 and 15.99 is euro for aug 12, 2011.  The exchange rate between those currencies is 0.9568."
"[INST] Should I invest in real estate to rent, real estate to live in, or just stocks and bonds to earn 10-15%? [/INST]","If we are talking long term, the real estate option has a lot of potential. But at the risk. The risk of the mortgage, the risk of the contract, the market's reaction, the bad tenant, the bad realtor, etc. The stock is the safest option to go for. If there are 11 or more options, stocks is the option with the highest average return. And you can still invest into Real Estate for instance you can get REIT Stocks. I would say that it is a personal choice, it depends what you want: passive income or short term profit.","A few notes on this question: Renting is probably not the option you would want to pursue.  The returns aren't even that great, and you would have to deal with the hassles of owning the property, including dealing with rental problems, fixing everything that breaks, paying property taxes, insurance, etc.  For a long term investment I'd recommend just to stick to stocks and bonds, or consider a roth IRAs, 401K, etc.  Real estage is not liquid, and most people don't get anything close to the 10-15% annually.  Most people get 7% annualized return, at best, with some downside risk."
[INST] Is it really possible to get rich in only a few years by investing? [/INST],"You are probably thinking of the ""Rich Dad"" series of books from the Robert Kiyosaki line.  I own both these books and find them the most inspirational of all of his books.  Basically, it goes like this... The problem with your investment portfolio is that it is diversified.   Diversification is a nice way to tell your stock broker that you don't have a clue about investing. If you want to get rich, you don't want to diversify.  You want to pick one asset class and put all your money into them.  The reason diversification is recommended is because it lowers risk so your portfolio doesn't drop as much as the whole market.  But, low risk means low reward... to the tune of about 6% annually in the last 100 years. To do what Robert Kiyosaki says and do well, you need to pick the right asset class.  You also need to pick it correctly.  If you pick a stock with a price of $.25/share in 2000, you need to sell today for it to be a successful investment.  This is the hardest part of investing and the biggest obstacle in your path to riches.  You need to be able to ""sell it too early"" or ""sell it too late."" The real problem is that many people find it hard to let go of a mistake.  They hang on to it, thinking maybe next quarter it will turn around.  This is why diversification is needed.  You put a little into many things because you hope that somewhere, it will hit.  But when you really want to get rich, don't do that.  Put it into one type of investment.  Stocks are good, real estate is very popular, but in the end, you need to find the industry or area you are comfortable with. So, in short, yes it's doable.  But it also carries a huge risk factor.  If you pick wrong, your whole portfolio can fall to zero.  If picking the right asset class becomes a problem for you (as it was for me) then you need to stick with diversification, and settle for making 6% annually. I recommend these to anyone wanting to learn about ""growth investing"":","The problem is that, first, this is like saying Is it possible. It's possible that you can do this. I'd say that the chances are not much. And yes, it is actually possible. But that doesn't mean someone will do it. It happens, but not very often. I'm not saying one should not try, but, really, not many succeed there. So you get a 50,000 dollar investment, and in 15 year time it grows 75-fold. That's an annual rate on average of 19.5% CAGR or  Compound Annual Growth Rate. What you want is the total. This is pretty much impossible. A 75 times growth 75%/year. Yes, possible. 75 times growth year after year. I don't think so. This is not a single stock question, is a general one about investing. I'm not a US citizen, but I'd be very careful about who would be the custodian/broker of such a 50,000 dollars account. In a number of countries I know that in a number of countries you have very little say on what happens to such an investment from that point onward, the custodian can be the one to determine where to put the investment.  Also, you can't know if 7.8% is not the limit. If it's the limit, you can't get even 750K. But, yes, in theory it is possible to do this."
[INST] Issuing bonds at discount - computing effective interest rate [/INST],"The 2% premium can be thought of as an option, which the buyer is choosing to accept in the form of a reduced coupon rate. The value of the option can be calculated according to the value function of the American derivative option (see Wikipedia), and you will find that the value of the option is 0.5063, or the premium should have been $3.02. As such, you can find a relationship between the yield to maturity and coupon rate, the same as the one you mentioned. One can also show, using the above calculations, that at the given maturity, time and initial yield to maturity of 4%, the option will be worth more than $3.02, meaning that the current price should be below par at a price of $\$4.02566196 for a bond with $100 principal, a coupon of 0.25 percent and a maturity of 10 years (see spreadsheet I've designed for the purpose). Of course, it's possible that, if the stock market keeps falling, the yield to maturity of the bond will end up above what it is now, making the discount more ""logical.""  For instance, if the YTM ends up near 10%, your bond is only worth $38.38, which is below what it currently is.  In that way, the price of the bond can be thought as a forward measure of what the YTM may be at the future date.  However, I doubt you'll see anything lower than the above 4% YTM in 10 years time.","You cannot compute YTM for a bond issued with a discount. The discount represents the premium over par that was paid to purchase. For instance, you would purchase a bond with a face value of $100 for $85 and the discount would be the premium, or the difference of $15. If you were interested in purchasing the bond and would need to determine what the return would be for that investment.  In order to understand YTM is used to describe how much interest was paid (and paid on time) as part of the payment amount. This means that a bond sold for $85 with a face value of $100 that is paid $2 a year with no further payments (in this case the return, or yield on the investment), would still have a YTM of 5% ($2/$40).  The coupon/yield/maturity date represents the period from you purchase the bond to the maturity date (for the above example, the next coupon payment). The term is the next coupon payment minus coupon. In your case that would still be 3.61% ($1.34/$40). With the information provided, it is impossible to see why the YTM and term do not make sense. You do not provide any payment info, and the term and coupon are inconsistent.

[INST] Found an old un-cashed paycheck. How long is it good for? What to do if it's expired? [/INST],"I assume the check is from a legitimate employer? If so, the check is probably still valid. Check with your bank: I would ask specifically about the laws, as different states may have a different time a check is valid. In my experience I've never heard of a check not being valid. It's a fairly safe bet to cash/deposit it with your bank. If they'll do it for you, go ahead, if not you can try the bank the check is from. There may be a small charge for doing this, as depositing/cashing another bank's check is pretty rare.","A check is good generally for 180 days from issue, if it is not paid. It is also subject to the terms and conditions in the account agreement. If a check is 'stale dated', the bank will pay it after the drawer/depositor agrees to pay a fee to 'float' the check, but only if it is deposited at the account holder's financial institution and subject to a 180 day deadline. I.E. - the check can be made good with the stale dating being ignored. I'm not going to delve into the exact legalities here, but if you want to know the specifics of your legal rights, talk to a local attorney."
[INST] What are the options for a 19-year-old college student who only has about $1000? [/INST],"You don't say on what time frame you think about investing, but a couple of ideas are: A lottery type investment. There are pools of people making those types of investments. I am not talking about a big company that has those types (I have looked into them and decided against it), I am thinking of friends or close relatives. For Example let's say a group of 10 get together and each put $100 in and then you have $1,000.  You all get a piece of the action (and whatever they invest in) so the risk is spread out. Or if they want to gift some of it to you. It is a high risk though so be prepared to lose it all. If you are young you could look into investing it. However $1,000 will never get you anywhere and will get eaten up by fees and losses, so you should try to add to it whenever you have a little additional cash. A little more than a hundred maybe, and also try to put it into some sort of retirement account (like an IRA or Roth IRA). The money in that account will grow, and when it's time to retire you will have income for your golden years. But don't let the power of compound interest fool you, starting with just $100 at 36 years old can bring you to a net worth of $70,000 when you do retire. Imagine how much more having that started now can do for you in the future.","I have read the other answers and will give some insight on the part that's neglected a bit.   First off, congrats on your interest and initiative to learn about investing.  We should all have these characteristics from when we're young and fresh out of college.  This is the point in which we should do the most.   You are a young person, so the rule is...invest in low cost, passively managed, index funds.  Nothing that is actively managed and nothing that is short term.   Index funds are basically a mutual fund that reflects a particular index, like the Standard & Poor 500 or the Russell 3,000.   A low cost index fund is one that has a expense ratio of 0.20% or less (or 20 bps).  Mutual funds have an expense ratio, it's essentially the fee that they charge for buying into the fund.  If the expense ratio is high, say 1.50% or more, then it eats into your returns a decent amount.   Also, avoid actively managed funds as this is essentially an individual with a team of research assistants who try to get the best stock based on their view of the future.  They can do this a couple of days, then they can do it for years, but either way they're not good at it.  Look at the history of the manager(s) and you'll see how they did in the past and how they're doing now with the same picks.  If they made money in the past, that's great, but are they doing similarly today.  Generosity has its limits.   Index funds have a lot of other great attributes including broad diversification, low turnover, and low taxes.  I mean, really, they have it all.   Passively managed means that no one is actively picking stocks, so it avoids picking bad stocks.  This eliminates the downside of paying people to pick bad winners.  Now, let me be real clear, it's not all perfect.  Sometimes the stocks are so good or bad that the index fund is slow to reflect this change.  Also, a company can go bankrupt and the index fund may reflect this change slowly or may not reflect it at all.  That's just the way that the stock market is and the whole index fund is really just a reflection of the stock market.  A fund company may have great managers for the various sectors.  But it's up to those managers to outperform the market they're competing against.   So, look for an index fund with a low expense ratio, look for passively managed, and avoid actively managed funds.  There are a lot of options, but I'm sure you'll be able to find some that fit those requirements.  Vanguard, for instance, has some good ones that will meet your needs.  Do a little homework and you'll find the perfect index fund."

[INST] What benefits do “title search companies” have over physically visiting a land records offices? [/INST],"Title companies handle all of a property transfer process, including ordering the title search.  If you hire them for an existing property they will check the existing title to see what has happened since it was last title-certified which is usually when a deed was recorded.  If you are having a new title search done, then they will search for any relevant documents prior to the date of title search. If you get it done through them, and the search comes up clean, there is less work for you to do before making it official.  If there is a cloud on the title, they will work to remove the cloud.  This could involve contacting the other parties, including their bank/mortgage company if there is a lien or foreclosure. The bank may require a payoff amount (or a larger balance than is really left on the mortgage) for the lien to be removed.  They will need the title cleared before they can record it in their name.  Otherwise the sale will fail. With an existing title, they can usually just record the title transfer.  But as I stated for any existing title issues, they may have to contact those other parties.  But if you do an unrelated search first, then you'll know well in advance if the title is clouded, or if you need to take some action to clear it before the transfer is final.  In the meantime, you can start the legal work of selling.   There are some documents you can do on your own before the title transfer, but doing the title search through them will save a lot of time and effort getting to that point.  But you probably cannot legally advertise the sale (as title transfer may be a condition of the sale) until after the title transfer has been approved, and it can take several weeks (or longer if there are issues with the other parties).  You can't just go rent the equipment/truck, then start hauling dirt to build the road in/move the fill from you property before all the transfer legal work is done and recorded.  Doing the title search through them will save a lot of heartbreak later on if it turns out they can't complete the work and the road project is left unfinished.","You should start here - http://www.irs.gov/uac/Home-Owner-Closing-Credits - In all states, the purchase price of a home must be within $1 million of the fair market value (FMV) of the home in order to qualify for the $8,000 Home Buyer Tax Credit. However, the FMV must be between $150,000 and $850,000 to qualify for the program as a whole. If the FMV of your home ends up below the $150,000 threshold, you won't need a full appraisal (or even a visit from Zillow) to qualify for this Homebuyer's Tax Credit - the Internal Revenue Service won't bother to ask. If you are paying below market price for land, you may find a lender who will accept an appraisal on the land alone. But, in a competitive market and with appraisers looking to avoid problems, I would expect they would be unlikely to do so. I would recommend you have your own lawyer and title agency/title search company to do all of the preliminary work. These companies do not only do title searches, they do many other things: Here is a partial list of services provided by a reputable company: There are lots of reputable companies around the United States and you should be able to find one in your area.

[INST] Joining a company being acquired [/INST],"Being that this is a long term goal, my advice is to talk to people who work for different types of companies and ask them what they found appealing about working there. From those conversations take what appeals to you and use it as criteria for your job hunt. Here's some ideas: - Location of the company; can you go home for lunch during lunch breaks, or would you end up spending lots of time in commuting? - What does it feel like when walking into the office; does it feel welcoming and homely, or stark and intimidating? - What does it feel like to work there; do people seem happy to work there, or do they dread work and the weekends? - What is the technology provided; is it old or new? Are you expected to provide your own equipment, or will they provide it for you? What skills & experience do you need in order to do well? What skills & experience are you lacking? Is there anything stopping you from gaining those skills or experience now?","As another person brought up in another answer, you are essentially proposing to do to your employer today what your employer is doing to you. This isn't really a reason not to make the move, as long as you're okay with this ""what goes around comes around"" karma. If you're a valuable employee that they care about, it's entirely plausible that your position will be absorbed into their structure, or the new entity may even retain the offerings you were involved in creating. So maybe they're doing this with you in mind, maybe that's even why they hired you in the first place. But of course you never know. If you accept their offer, you may be better off with an equity arrangement with the new employer than with their severance package. The icing on the cake is that you can look forward to a day when you're the boss with hiring power and you can turn the tables on some of your old company co-workers. If you accept their offer, it will be on the condition that you have to do things differently than your bosses did."
[INST] is the bankruptcy of exchange markets possible? [/INST],"Yes, the bankruptcy of exchange markets is possible. Exchange markets can become insolvent due to factors such as bad governance, fraud, or economic instability. This can lead to a loss of value in the securities exchanged on the market. In the event of a market bankruptcy, any outstanding debts will have to be settled and the market may have to restructure or be acquired by another entity.","Of course it is possible that an exchange will go bankrupt. We have seen a handful of exchanges go bankrupt recently and several more are currently on the ropes, or at least seem to be teetering. At the root of the issues facing exchanges (particularly the larger ones) is the same thing that is at the core of all financial crises... leverage and counterparty risk. As was discussed in this post, the main form of counterparty risk faced by exchange platforms is clearing and settlement risk. The clearing and settlement process is complex and, in my opinion, often quite difficult to understand. In this diagram I simplify things by depicting the clearing and settlement process at it's simplest: Exchanges are at the core of this process. They match and confirm counterparty positions. In addition to this role, though, exchanges also provide clearing services. Clearing services guarantee that each party actually owns the assets it has purchased. If party A in my example doesn't have the funds in their account, then exchange X would return those funds to party B. After the trade is officially confirmed the funds are sent from party A to the clearing account with exchange X, then they are transferred to the custodial bank from which they are finally sent to party B. There are other factors that can lead to an exchange failure; the one discussed most often by the press is fraudulent front-running. However, my experience of the actual workings of financial services tells me that fraud is not the dominant issue. In my experience the problem has and will continue to be a mismatch between risk appetite and risk strategy. Banks, for example, are great at managing the risks between them but they don't have a good track record of managing counterparty risk. Financial services firms, hedge funds and exchanges are good at managing counterparty risk but are atrocious when it comes to managing operational risk and managing risk exposure between themselves. As a result of the financial crisis, banks have withdrawn from the business of counterparty risk management because they didn't want to take on the operational burden. The largest financial institutions are doing the same now as a result of this crisis. That leaves many markets with little or no counterparty risk management and those markets will fail.  I will say that there are other reasons, particularly geopolitical, why exchanges can fail. They include political crises, cyber attacks and regulatory pressures. The risk appetite in those cases is the problem, not the strategy to manage or mitigate risk. However, when it comes to the financial risk taken by an exchange, my belief is that they are making a huge mistake in withdrawing from counterparty risk management. It would seem only a matter of time before another large exchange fails as a result of managing the counterparty risk on its books poorly."
[INST] Can I get a mortgage from a foreign bank? [/INST],"I have successfully done so. I had a mortgage through NIB in 2006-2009. As of Jan 2016, my wife and I have a mortgage through BNP Paribas. My only advice is that if possible, try to be physically in the country so that communications can get done faster. For example when I applied, NIB (Credit Agricole) was the only bank that had a branch in Sweden to my knowledge. This caused a lot of issues, a delay of several weeks when applying in 2005, and more issues when applying for a second mortgage in 2008. I think both banks have offices in Sweden, or at least BNP have.","That depends. What is your current situation? For example, If you are a citizen of the country that the bank you are asking about is in, then that would complicate matters. If you aren't a citizen, but say, your permanent resident, that might change things. Most banks operate under international agreements, but some don't. The rules for buying property will probably be different between two countries. If you buy in Country A then you probably will be affected by country A rules, but not country B rules. If you buy in Country B, then you are affected by country B rule, but not country A rules. That's just a random example. So there are a lot of variables. I think the short answer is, your current situation will determine a lot. Good luck!"
[INST] What are some of the key identifiers/characters of an undervalued stock? [/INST],"Any stock might not accurately reflect the actual market value of any particular company. However, when an investment property or stock is traded, the price it is selling at and the value it is currently considered to be may have several considerations. The market value or equity value of a business will change as the company grows, shrink and make more or less profits. Investment properties which will provide a steady stream of income and return on their initial investors, will also have an appraised value which may reflect how well they will pay to keep investors over a period of time. A stock's traded price is the result of many factors including (but not limited to) the current trading volume and whether the company in the stock is a profitable investment at the current price and the current market conditions. What investors perceive as a profit at a stock's current price may be very different than the actual company's management and may be completely different to what an appraisal of the company and its property suggests. There is nothing which can be done to easily ascertain if a stock is undervalued for a company, except to compare it to its actual market appraised value.","Some of the most popular and successful metrics of fundamental analysis are: For quantitative analysis the most popular tools used today are: For the beginner researching a particular company or industry, a combination of the above will give you a very good understanding of whether the stock is undervalued or not. A lot of people look at the ""Price/Earning"" ratio because this gives you a better appreciation of the share price when its earnings is a high multiple (e.g. 32X P/E) rather than a low multiple (e.g. 6X P/E)."
[INST] Owning REIT vs owning real estate - which has a better hypothetical ROI? [/INST],"While owning a piece of equity isn't going to produce a higher ROI than owning a piece of a REIT, since the price of a share of equity is going to rise based on the performance of both the real estate properties AND the performance of the underlying economy, since the REIT will mostly only be affected by the property, it's likely that a REIT will experience a better ROI, just because it can better contain the volatility of the stock market overall.","Both the market for REITs and the Real Estate market are in turmoil and it may be difficult to see whether one is better than the other during these times.  But it is important to be able to use comparative analysis in decision making for all possible alternatives.  Real estate is generally accepted to be cyclical (it has highs and lows) whereas the stock market is believed to be based more on supply and demand.  REITs may provide a good starting point, but if you know a certain property has a rental rate above the market rate and is in a high growing area maybe real estate purchases are the way to go.  I like to use charts to compare price movements of two variables against the price movement of a third, in this question it should be good to compare the performance of the REITs against other stocks in the market.  I would also use a good Real Estate index as a comparative.   The chart below is from www.stockcharts.com of an equal weighted REIT index vs a CPI adjusted Real Estate index.  These charts are from July 2007 to mid-June 2008.  So when we do a comparison they will give us a good idea of a REIT vs Real Estate performance in a declining market.  The two indices are based on real properties and I do not have any insight on why they chose these two indices for a comparison except that they could easily be compared. The REIT index is at the top of the chart and the real estate index is at the bottom.  The chart shows that REITs were the dominant force for the first few months.  As the chart ends, it shows the REIT index being outperformed over a small time span.  I hope this provides a starting point you can use to make a comparative study.   Hope this helps the question is well thought out.  When making comparisons between REITs and Real Estate there is no better comparison than this one, the REIT index was equal weighted compared to a CPI adjusted real estate index.  The chart shows that the REITs outperformed the real estate index from July until about June.  It took until July of 2008 to close the price gap between the two indices because the real estate index outpaced the REIT index near the end of the chart."
[INST] Can I do periodic rollovers from my low-perfoming 401k to an IRA? [/INST],"I don't think there is any prohibition against rolling from a 401k to another 401k to avoid the 60 day waiting period. So perhaps you can continue to roll from 401k to 401k while you fund 3 IRA accounts (one for each Roth, Trad and Solo 401k limit). But you'll need your 401k employer to match at least the Roth limit and to use the Roth 401k if you use Solo 401k at some point.","The answer to your questions will differ by situation.  1)   There is a 1099-R at the end of the year (I assume) that will show   that a cash rollover distribution was made. You simply include this on your   return as any other 1099-distributable income.  2)   There is nothing in the 1099-R indicating what you can do with the   proceeds. Can you simply elect to transfer the distribution directly to another investment vehicle?  In other words, you are saying the IRA is at Fidelity. You roll the cash over from 401k, Fidelity, to say Vanguard. You don't really deal with the cash, the company that got the cash from 401k puts it directly against your chosen IRA vehicle. Note though, that you don't necessarily have to get the cash out from the 401K right away, most places allow you to transfer in from say Vanguard, to them, then the money will transfer. They just need the 1099-R so that they can do the 1099-R on the other side, it will show the correct amounts. (You don't show both, the one is reported to the receiving entity, the second to the sending entity, they just report what you said you did.) The 1099-R on the receiving side will be from the receiving entity not the 401k provider. The 401K provider doesn't know what you actually did with the cash, they received the cash, sent it to the broker, and called it a roll over. That is why the receiving side shows the correct amount, the 401k provider can't do much more then tell you they took the cash. On the next point: 3) The 401K administrator can't stop you from rolling over your balance to any broker you please. They cannot stop you from rolling over part of your balance, just your entire balance. They cannot stop you from doing rolling over into the same brokerage that provides your current 401k (which your post doesn't appear to suggest you are doing), and they cannot stop you from rolling straight into a deposit account, and even though I would expect that you want to transfer that money into investing, the 401 provider cannot stop you. (They may have some kind of penalty you need to pay though.)"
[INST] UK Resident exploring freelance work for a Swiss Company [/INST],"If you're not registered as an off-shore company, you won't be able to draw that money out of your Swiss bank account. There will be limitations on foreign exchange, and in the case of the USA, you may not be permitted any further exchange with regards to your current (read: pre-2013) account. In short, to do what you're talking about, you need to register your company at (for example) Virgin start-ups in the UK and then you'll be able to open a Swiss bank account directly into the Virgin business account. After tax and some time, you then have two business accounts in two countries.","@littleadv has a great answer for the first part of this question (and he's right, the first page you linked says that the contractor does the work, not the company).  For the HMRC view, I think you're right in that you should make some attempts to find a better source, I would suggest talking to a professional accountant who is a member of AAT/CIMA/ACCA/ACA or another chartered professional body to ensure they aren't likely to give you bad advice. They'll be able to advise you over the phone or in person and will be able to advise you if the contract is likely to be deemed contractor rather than employees via an IR35 type test based upon HMRC guidelines. These guys will cost a bit but are a lot better than wasting a few days going in circles with HR and your manager(s). As your contractor should already have an accountant who is paid to be your advocate with HMRC, you don't really need two accounts to try and work things out for yourself unless you want to, then it's best to go to a place like the Accountants of the World and get an adviser on there (who again, should be chartered) and ask who would be best in your area? Be careful, some of these type of sites will also pay your adviser a ""rebate"" so they will be pushing you towards some firm so go for one that seems credible and has loads of reviews. For more details on the tax, you can find more information on HMRC's Tax Guide for Overseas Businesses here: https://www.gov.uk/tax-on-non-resident-companies There is even a calculator on the HMRC site, which allows you to submit some details, e.g. turnover, profits, employee / non employee / UK expenses etc to get an indication and more explanation. For other tax questions, the best site to visit would be the UK's national tax authority itself, HMRC (who should know more than anybody else) which you can visit here: http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ They provide a lot of information about your tax responsibilities and how to pay tax and National Insurance contributions, etc."
[INST] Is it bad etiquette to use a credit or debit card to pay for single figure amounts at the POS [/INST],"There's your answer. Credit cards are meant to be used for convenience, not to accumulate a large balance that you won't repay for years on end. If you were to buy, say, $100 of goods every day, you'd be paying 10x the interest for doing so than if you had accumulated the cash over that period and simply paid the cashier. So, no, it isn't about respect, and you're not cheap by paying with cash. Credit card payments are usually done at a 60-90 day window, so paying with card in this manner can actually help you accumulate rewards points. And paying a service fee is much cheaper than paying a late fee, or even a bounced check fee, for missing a payment. Paying with cash is cheap. Paying with credit is convenient.","I think this question is a little bit outdated and misses an important concept. Most people don't actually hand over their credit/debit cards to pay. We pay using payment portals like apple pay, and google pay, or by using QR codes. So as long as we know that we are doing this correctly, it does not really matter what the merchant is charging for, we have our own little system already set. The only other option would be to use cash which I think has already been covered in other answers."
[INST] How to find cheaper alternatives to a traditional home telephone line? [/INST],"Why do you care? Unless you need to do conference calls regularly at that phone number, why is this important? You can get a call forwarding service for under $5/month. That's actually easier to deal with than having a phone line and dealing with all that stuff. Also, you can get an online fax number. You never have to worry about it. Just have it forwarded to you and deal with the online website when you need a fax sent.","The cheapest way to talk on an analog phone system is with a MagicJack Plus device. As mentioned, you'll need something like Google Voice or Skype Talk if you want to have a physical number. You'll be charged the regular rates for incoming and outgoing calls, but it's usually far cheaper ($0.20/min or less for long distance). If having Google Voice, Google Talk (or another provider, which you choose from SkypeOut available numbers), or a Skype number is too risky, there are a couple of options. First is to obtain a number from the phone company of your area; if you're like my area, you only pay $15/yr for the number. Unfortunately some providers use Skype's numbers instead of using the traditional phone number systems. However, you may be able to use a MagicJack Plus and a Sylar SIPA2T adapter, so you can dial as a local number to a POTS phone number, or call a SkypeOut number and have it ring on your local SIPA2T adapter, and call it from your POTS phone! The other option is if you want a phone but don't want the hassle of long distance charges. Check out Ooma. You get a year's worth of free calls with the device they provide. After that, in many cases, you can get away with very low rates. Not sure about incoming calls but there are plenty of VOIP providers that offer free incoming calls from the U.S. and landlines; you only need to provide them with a working phone number. Forwarding that phone number to your VOIP number will take the place of a physical analog line"
[INST] Typical return for an IRA?  How can I assess if my returns were decent? [/INST],"You need to consider that mutual funds, especially S&P 500 funds, have high expenses.  Those expenses take money off the top before even the gains are credited.  While they invest the money that remains and pay distributions after that, that doesn't mean there's money in the account.  The fund could also lose money as well and the balance will drop.  The value of the fund shares is not money you can withdraw.  It's the underlying assets (stocks or bonds in this case).  What you want to know is how much you would have had in the account if the fund hadn't made any deductions from the dividends, i.e.: How much did the fund make minus the expense ratio.   Here's the formula for getting the value of the shares in the account: Share Price = Beginning value / (1 + Yield - Expense Ratio (ER)) ^ Years   (You'd need to take a percent and convert it to a decimal first) So for the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, you have it at $39.81.  The value per share for the fund right now is 34.12.  If you subtract that from $39.81 you get $5.69.  The fund has lost $5.69/share over its lifetime.  So 5.69/34.12 = 16.9%  That's your expense ratio.  You are not losing 1% per year for expenses.  Your funds are losing money for expenses and you don't know when to invest in them.  So you would have lost an extra $1 from having started off with $6.66/share on January 3, 2005 (Jan 21, 2008 in your comment below).  That's another 2.7%/year for this period.  The expense ratio for the Total Market Index would be ~19.6%.","When you invest in an IRA, you are basically investing in the stock market, bonds, mutual funds, money market funds, precious metals, cash, or alternative investments.  The return you get will depend on the investments you make in that particular IRA.  In general, the stock market has an annualized return of about 11.5%, the average bond return is about 4.5%, and the average return for stocks combined with bonds is 9.5%.  Some of the investments could see annual returns over 40% in a good year, and they could see losses in a year.  You can determine the return on your particular investment by dividing your ending balance by your starting balance, and then subtracting unity from the results.  Most IRA providers give a detailed report of the return on investment, which can tell you whether you are hitting your target return."
[INST] Would I qualify for a USDA loan? [/INST],"I see a lot of folks saying they qualify for government assistance but are buying homes that are out of reach of other assistance programs.  You have several choices if you find yourself in this position. 1) Buy a less expensive home. This is the obvious one and should be the first you consider.  2) Buy the home you want and then pay more for closing costs, taxes and insurance since your PMI costs are going to be higher.  Keep the home for ten years, and then refinance at 20% when your PMI drops out.  You can then get cash out, or another appraisal of the home. See the problem here?  That is 30 years, and you're 27. What if the market tanks?  In 10 years home values might be back down to where you paid.  You've now spent 10 years of your life working to pay a mortgage.  If it goes down, so does the property tax value, so there won't be an increase.  However that's like buying an old used car for $10k, and then finding 10 years later you have to start sinking more and more into it just to keep it running.  You can only drive it so far before it just dies.  That's kind of where that is going to get you. 3) Buy the home and then sell it in 10 years when the PMI is gone.  This is what you should be shooting for.  Here's one you might not have considered. 4) When your mortgage is paid off in 30 years, then start your retirement.  You'll have 20% down on your first home at that point, and a 15 year mortgage.  You'll have more flexibility later if needed for a more expensive home, or whatever.","Yes, even though your income is just shy of the USDA income requirements your mortgage should go through with the assistance of a good loan officer and real estate agent. In my past experience with lenders, the qualifying process for USDA involves an in-person meeting (and maybe an in-person application) involving the underwriters. Make sure you get pre-approved first though before even thinking of an in-person application. The loan officer will probably ask for a lot of tax documents, pay stubs, and bank statements to justify your income if you are just shy of qualifying. If that's the case, you should have a good chance of getting the loan. It could be the underwriters want you to qualify in case of a recession. As long as the income requirements are still the way they are, you should qualify with all the proper paperwork and documentation. If you don't, just try to adjust your monthly payment down to fit within what's allowed. It may be tough, but there is still a chance. Best of luck with everything. Let me know if you have any other questions. I'm still an undergrad undergoing a personal crisis (no money is flowing into my pocket) so if someone else can help you out feel free to use them."
[INST] How can I improve my credit score if I am not paying bills or rent? [/INST],"It sounds like you are going to be living at home for a while and have no plan to pay bills. This can be a very dangerous scenario and should be avoided at all costs. You are very young, but it is important to be smart about credit. The easiest, cheapest, and best way to start establishing credit is to get a secured credit card. You will put a security deposit down, they will give you a credit card, then you make payments.  I had one for 4 years with a $500 limit. After 18 months my account was moved to a different line of credit, which then up my limit to $1000 after another 18 months. Keep in mind, that this does nothing to improve your credit score. Every bill payment from here on out does. If you want to see what makes up your score, I would check with annualcreditreport.com. You can get each of your reports for free once a year from the three major credit bureaus, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax.  In the future, if you want to buy a car, the dealer will most likely ask for your credit to see if you are approved for financing. This might be a long time out if you are only 19 years old. It depends on where you want to live, and if you want to buy a new car, or not. In other words, not paying anything is probably the worst thing you can do. Pay on time, or it will come back to haunt you.",I think you should look into your parents credit report. Maybe your parents can add you to a secured credit card account they have. Then you can look at your credit score.

No there isn't, and since they don't round, it's an odd question.  Massachusetts sales tax is currently 6.25%.  6.25% * $2.99 is $0.18375. There's no way to represent a penny with change in US currency. There are ten different coins. If the cash register has those available, you can get change in multiples of $0.01, $0.05, $0.10, $0.25, and $1. No cents, because we don't have decimal currency. So you should expect $0.20. If the register has no coins smaller than $0.25, you may get $0.30, $0.35, $0.40 or $0.50. The point of a penny may be lost in our metric world, but here in the US it's still in use. This also means that 98.49% is likely to be rounded to 98.50%.  98.44% rounded round 98.40%. There doesn't appear to be any magic about $80 or $173.22 that justifies rounding down to $80 or $173. The rounding seems to be applied to amounts just for the convenience of the cashiers. As the tax rates went up, rounding up to a higher denomination became less likely."
[INST] When should I start saving/investing for my retirement? [/INST],"The general consensus from other answers is you should start today.  While that might be the ""right"" thing to do, it might be very hard to do.  For example, you might be too busy dealing with the challenges of daily living to actually get around to it (see inertia effect below). It's important to understand why other people recommend starting now... they're recommending it not so that you stop spending the bulk of your paycheck (which is important too, but I'll get to that later)... they're recommending that, because they're pointing out these 5 primary factors: Compounding effect of exponential return The sooner you plan to retire the more time your money will need to accumulate in your retirement fund.  This also helps you to see that retirement is not a finite number of years away.  The sooner you start the more money you will have (especially if you also use dollar cost averaging to buy dividend-paying stocks).  You can actually use this ""fact"" to your advantage and pretend you're 10 or 15 years older (say you're 25 years old and your retirement age is 60, pretend you're 35 years old). Inertia effect of delayed investment For many working people, simply choosing to invest now is a powerful step to ensure that you actually do invest.  You have to realize that you are fighting your own inertia right now even if you know it's the right thing to do in this case.  It took you years to put things off and get to a point where you even asked this question, and unless you work hard to make your first investment step, you could put it off for years and then wonder why you have less money saved 20 or 30 years into your career.  You will never accumulate retirement funds if you never invest. Disengagement effect of delayed investment Even if you do finally get around to investing in retirement, you might realize that you are at a point of your life where you might be better off contributing to a 401(k) plan today.  Employer matching funds are an excellent way to get your first contribution started.  It not only matches some of your investment, but you're also contributing to your retirement.  You don't find that if you've been investing in the stock market for years on your own.  The 401(k) plan, in my opinion, is one of the greatest inventions for people who can take advantage of it.  They say don't put all of your eggs in one basket, but that's very hard if you're investing in one place (i.e. the stock market), the 401(k) is your way of expanding what you're already trying to do.  If you're worried about a company-managed plan, just don't take more than what you're going to contribute for the employer matching funds... you're still saving money even if your investments don't beat the S&P 500.  You're more likely to be successful by using both investment tools.  The more money you contribute to one, the less you need to contribute to the other to reach your retirement goal. Cost of investing When I was in college, I learned that even though all the financial analysts were saying that index funds were the best way to invest, the cost of investing was too expensive (around 30 basis points) if you were investing your own money (not as part of a 401(k) plan).  Even at a cost of $5/month, you would save around $40,000 by doing your own investing.  This cost argument can even be used as a way of not investing at all.  This is a catch-22... you're too poor to start investing because you haven't invested yet.  You have to do your homework (like you're going to do in Step 3), make a decision and get on with it.  If you're investing for yourself and can find a way to reduce the cost, that's great.  You might find that you need to change your investment strategy (involving dividend-paying stocks), invest in the stock market but use dollar cost averaging or even put extra money into your mortgage (as a form of investment) instead (see The Millionaire Next Door).  Just be sure whatever investing plan you choose involves both of the following (and you can't afford to skip either one):  Compounding The inertia effect the inertia effect the delayed investment The disengagement effect of delayed investment The cost of","As a young professional, the best investment you can make is in yourself. The best way to build wealth for retirement is to continue your education, build your skills, and gain more experience.  There are many paths you can choose to take, but the most important thing to do is to get started before it's too late. As far as investing in a retirement account goes, start now! You won't understand the compound growth that can happen unless you start now. Just look at the chart if you want an indication about how much value an investment can get.  Compound Interest You might not be able to dedicate a lot now, but it'll help you get going. Then, as you earn more, you can increase the investment a couple of years down the road."
[INST] I have savings and excess income. Is it time for me to find a financial advisor? [/INST],"How to find a financial adviser: Doctors have a lot of requirements about who they entrust their care to. The same should be true for financial advisers.  When choosing a financial adviser, consider the following: Consider the source: Most people I ask claim to have found their financial adviser because they knew someone working there. How convenient. It is difficult to get a referral to a financial adviser that specializes in doctors.  Instead, here are some better methods that ensure you are getting a well-trained, independent professional: Find someone with experience: Not all types of financial advisers have the same level of expertise.  A simple way to check the qualifications of the planner is to identify what certifications they hold. There are various planner certifications out there, with various degrees of credibility: Fee-only advisers avoid conflicts of interest: Be wary of advisers who make money by selling you mutual funds or other investment vehicles. To ensure your chosen financial planner does not receive compensation from product vendors in any form, look for someone who only receives compensation directly from their clients. (As a side note, if you have an adviser who also happens to work for a huge company, the two are not the same.)   Find an adviser that shares your perspective: Ask your candidates if they would be happy to act as a fiduciary—a person obligated to place your interests above their own. If not, consider finding someone else. Consider the cost: Look carefully at what you are getting for what you are spending.  Fee-only advisers tend to be cheaper simply because they have no conflicts of interests, which can drive product costs through the roof. You should always be able to discuss their pricing directly with your adviser, up front.  Note that some advisers, like Edward Jones, charge you a fee, but only for financial planning services. When you place your investments through the company, additional fees come into play. And sometimes you might be charged a fee for the investment itself as well, which is not what my brokerage account fee entails.  Check the advisers you are considering.","No advisor is worth $3,899  (USD)  for the first meeting.  If you want that kind of high net worth service, then your income should be in the $100-200,000 per year range. If you pay a $3,899  (USD) per meeting, you would be at the $800 level per hour at the minimum. That is a waste of money in my humble opinion.  However, if you want to look into getting this kind of ""white glove"" service, then you can easily pay $200-400 per hour.  I am not the rich man you think you need, but based on your age (35) and income level ($100,000) you should be able to get a reasonable fee schedule or find people who would work with you in a reasonable manner.  $3,899  (USD) for 1 meeting is insane!  If you pay $40,000 or $50,000 for an entire year of financial service and management, then maybe you should consider getting a financial advisor.  Personally, I have $150,000 in my 401(k) and Roth contributions (IRA's) and no advisor.  I only have one advisor I have paid and that was 5 years ago.  He told me his opinion based on facts on a $200,000  (USD) bond and sold it at a 40% profit from $3,000 to $4,200.  The bond is now only worth $3,800 and I do not plan to sell it.  When I did the math, his services cost me another 20% so I lost 20%.  If I lost 20% on that bond I would have lost $600, but instead I made $2,200."
[INST] How can I register a UK business without providing a business address? [/INST],"You can use Royal Mail ""Service 5"" or any alternative registered mail service that will send back the paperwork. It has to be a service that has a tracking number that allows the business registration office to confirm delivery. Also, for some services (including Royal Mail) the registered address is only one of a couple of places where paperwork can be dispatched. You still need to specify at least your home address when filling in the form with Companies House. This is the address that will be on all the documents about your business you deal with (including the register itself and shareholder certicates/registers) and is legally the location of your business.","The rules are very clear on this question: if you give them the false information they can take your money and shut you down, no questions asked. This means that you have to provide a complete and valid address that can prove to be valid. If you're living outside of the UK, then you could use your bank address, which has to be a physical address to be accepted by UK Companies House. But you will only use that address to register the business: you may be able to change it later to whatever address you prefer (and your local bank will still let you open a business account), but you will get in trouble if you give false information, and your bank will close the account if you give false information. This means that unless the bank is willing to accept a fake address to give you money, you will have to find another bank, or change the business address yourself afterwards. If you're working remotely (as you said on the update), you don't have any problem. You can give any address that you normally receive mail at as your business address, and then forward it to your home. You just have to make sure that it is a valid address (not from a private POBox or similar fake information) and that you are eligible to receive business mail in that address (a POBox for example may not accept or may charge extra fees when receiving business mail). If you can't do that (say it's your parents' house but they won't forward you everything), then you can rent a virtual address to the company. You will need to show proof of identity, so don't go finding random services online (any kind of address would do for registering a company, so any virtual office that provides virtual addresses could work). But these services cannot be used for opening a business bank account and may be a pain to use when dealing with your customers, so make sure you are actually ok before getting the service for your business, and if the address services charge a lot of money, weigh the costs against the benefits. Also, note the address may be incomplete (only street and number, no house name or building number), and may not work for opening a bank account outside of the company, so be sure to verify everything with the virtual offices before signing an agreement. As a final note, if you have doubts make sure to use the Companies House's service to form a company. The price is higher (I believe it costs £25, while using a formation service may take only £10 plus the actual company formation price of £14, the lowest of all known services, which is £12 if I remember correctly), but your information will be verified and you can be sure it won't cause any trouble later on."
[INST] Where to start with finding good companies to invest? [/INST],"Look up who manages the biggest hedge funds in the world, read up on them and find out what they are investing in. But there's a catch, not all managers are great or have the performance they claim to. Also, it's not really easy to beat the market, but many managers boast they can. There are various lists that you can browse through to learn who those managers are. Read about and take notes on who the top-performing managers are, and then research those particular companies.  Another approach I've used in the past is to purchase mutual funds; I'd read about companies, but it takes a lot of research and can be tiring. Picking the right fund can give you exposure to a wide variety of companies.  The best thing to do is understand the various classes of mutual funds so that you understand what you're getting when you buy them. This link can be helpful.","A great way to learn about picking strong companies is the ""value investing"" approach of Warren Buffett. The main concept is you try to find companies with little to no debt, strong margins in income and profit, and reasonable price multiples relative to their earnings, and you buy more shares of those companies. If you're starting out with less than $50,000, it's probably best to use mutual funds to ease some of the risk, but to learn, you want to track the performance of your chosen mutual funds and see how they performed in the past versus the market. http://guruinvestor.com/articles has a great writeup on Mr. Buffett's approach, and his investments over the years.  Also, check out https://www.google.com/finance/quote?q=NASDAQ%3AH%7CBX%7CI%7CL%7CR%7CS%7CR&ei=kD8nUp_pDcy60gWf94HwCA for stock values and past performance, and https://www.google.com/finance/charts for a graphical view of a single stock's history. You want to find stocks that show positive returns year in and year out, and those can be found pretty easily by putting a number in the lower right input box and seeing which stocks rise in price when compared to the market (as the input number changes). So, take a few of those, and you may have a pretty good starting portfolio of funds."
[INST] Why is day trading considered riskier than long-term trading? [/INST],"There are a few reasons day trading is considered riskier: Emotions - Day trading encourages short-term thinking as opposed to long-term investing. For this reason, many investors make irrational decisions (eg. panic selling during sudden market downturns). Psychological research has shown that investors tend to get more emotional when making frequent decisions on short time horizons, and investors are very prone to herding effects.  This may lead to poor investment decisions that are not based on fundamentals, but instead based on ""the feeling of the moment"".   Market impact - An average investor may face significant fees and transaction costs. Moreover, their frequent trading strategy of purchasing and selling shares as soon as they perceive a price ""move"" leads to them facing market impact. This means they are ""hitting the tape"" at the wrong time and causing the price to move against them. This increases trading costs. Costs - Fees and trading costs can be very high when an investor frequently trades through online brokers.  Commissions, costs, taxes, financing expenses can be very high compared to the low costs an investor would pay by using a bank or institutional broker to invest on their preferred investment horizon (ie. buy and hold investing). Lines of credit (margin) are usually much smaller for day traders than they would be for institutional investors. Moreover, in periods of market volatility and high margin calls, day traders may have very short-term periods of leverage whereas institutional investors (with collateral) may have a longer time horizon.","There are many articles out there that have discussed the differences between day trading versus long term investing.  The one reason why many day traders are so focused on time spent in the market is that there are many market participants that are day traders. If you are playing with the market for only a short period of time, it is probably because you think you can time the market.  There are market participants who think that they can identify market trends, and be able to identify market cycles.  The problem is that not everyone can identify and repeat these market trends at the same profit margins you might be expecting.  Also, there are the traders that have a different style.  They might be what you would call contrarians, and they buy when the market is going down, or they might think that when the market is overvalued, they buy when the market is increasing and sell when the market is decreasing. This is why many market cycles are so important to some market traders.  The market has specific cycles and it might be based on economic cycles, or it might be based on some external event, and in a way, that is what these traders try to predict.  That is why many people prefer long term positioning over day trading."
"[INST] Why don't some places require a credit card receipt signature, and some do? [/INST]","I actually really hate those receipts, I always end up losing them. Most of the time I get a new card or close my account and I don't need the receipts, so I throw them away without getting them. For me the hassle of getting the receipt and signing it isn't necessarily worth the saving. Also, most credit card banks don't require the signature on the receipt.","I think the best answer I can provide is that it has become a business decision, based on business rules and guidelines set by the Credit Cards themselves.   This is where we get the differences between all of the different rules and business practices.  I am sure you have seen it before but when you put a credit cards in your wallet it actually breaks out into a large list of different companies.  For example, the most common type of credit card is actually American Express.  In your wallet it has a variety of logos on it, Mastercard for example.  This differentiation is part of the larger business decision.   I have worked in one of those large ""all credit card companies"" for a very large bank.  In it's old form there were only about four different brands/logos.  They wanted to create an umbrella brand to capture all the cards, something similar to CocaCola owning a variety of brands (Sprite, Powerade, Dasani) under the one umbrella of their business.  Unfortunately that umbrella brand got sold and the variety of brands that I have come to see now is how it works.  Each individual brand will work within their own guidelines, which has changed over the years.   If you are really interested in more information, and who is actually a business underneath the umbrella business, you might want to google around for:  Visa's Corporate Identity Group."
"[INST] Stocks taxed just for selling, or just when withdrawing? [/INST]","If it is an investment for your retirement, the gain from that stock or fund will only be taxed when you actually withdraw it for income. If it is an investment for generating current income or paying bills, it will be taxed as income.  There is no tax on holding a stock or fund. Some people have tax accounts where they put taxed money (income, gains) and non-taxed money and will buy stock in only those accounts, then make purchases with the taxed money or the non-taxed money as appropriate.","No. You can do short term gain or long term loss, you can do long term gain or short term loss, but you cannot do short term loss or long term gain."
[INST] Will paying off my car early hinder my ability to build credit? [/INST],"50K+ yearly income and you have credit issues?  How is this possible?  Are you spending money on non-essentials and inefficient ways?  The answers to this question can be used to help the future, if nothing else.  The best way to get more bang for your buck is to know exactly how and where you are spending.  I would say to invest the money that you were using to pay the car, for instance, in a dividend paying stock.  The money might as well working for you as long as it's not in the pockets of the banks.   On the other hand, with all that investment income, you have no reason not to be able to pay for a new car if the situation called for it.  You might not be happy in this situation as it can be less of a burden on you if you are paying a small payment for something you hate when you are saving some money for something you really like.  But you need not have to go into debt to get your new car.  If you are the one saying you should pay if off as fast as possible, do what you say!  Even if it is your ""finance person"" giving you the advice don't take it to heart.  This is one situation in which financial advice from a bank is a waste your time and money, do what you say!","You have the right idea. You should not need to carry debt on your vehicle or any other account, if you are financially able. As creditors see it; a customer that is paying their bills on time, and is not carrying debt, presents a lower risk than one that is borrowing money to pay bills. If you are borrowing, you are a greater credit risk because your need for extra money is a sign of insufficiency in your household budget. Of course, if you do that long enough, creditors will start assuming that you are not making as much money as you used to, and may try to lower your borrowing capacity; and then what? So, pay your debts, and try not to borrow money, because you don't really need to. The exception to this rule is student loans; if you still owe money after your degrees are paid for, you should at least make the minimum payments to avoid defaulting and going to collections. This can make it difficult to rent a place, and can severely affect your job prospects. Also, there are certain debts (like child support) that are not typically included in bankruptcy proceedings. Borrowing from your home equity to invest in something else is also a poor idea, but not for the reasons that Dave mentioned. Using your home as collateral for a loan that is invested into something that goes belly-up can lead to bankruptcy and a foreclosure. Using a home equity loan to purchase and renovate a home is a much different matter, as it can be argued that you will be able to recoup the costs that you paid to renovate the property (by increasing the sales price) while paying off the loan. A home equity loan to invest in paper is just foolish, even if the investment appreciates."
[INST] Must a company have a specific number of employees to do an IPO? [/INST],"IPOs are done by stock exchanges (the main one in the U.S. is NASDAQ), and the stock exchange is the one that decides what are the rules for companies to list. However, it seems that currently the lower limit is 400,000,000 USD of pre-money value (pre money: the estimated value of the company before the IPO takes place). For instance, AirAsia.com was planning an IPO in August 2011 and had a pre-money value of 1,300,000,000 USD (a billion USD less than the limit). Other stock exchanges, such as London Stock Exchange Group, may be different.","The only hard requirement, from the company's end is that they meet the minimum amount of shares in market price to go public.  Generally this will also require a minimum number of shares outstanding.  The requirements may also be adjusted higher due to the price range of stock, as many companies go public around a $10-$20/share price. If you are referring to a specific company and have questions about how many employees they have or how long they have been in business, you'll need to do additional research, as that information is not provided to the general public."
[INST] How to share income after marriage and kids? [/INST],"I think there are a few elements at play here so I'll just try to cover a few of them.  First of all, you're both putting in a ton of time caring for the children. You should appreciate the work effort of both of you. You mention that the children are so young and need so much attention right now. That is completely true and you can't expect one person to do it all. There are some expenses that have little flexibility. There are other ones that have a high amount of elasticity. An example of an inflexible expense is the mortgage payment. We have to pay that whether one of us is away or not, but things such as utilities are flexible. If one of you goes away on travel, the electric bill goes down. You must consider the elasticity of the expense in determining how it is divided up. However, it does not solve the problem as there is other stuff, such as the mortgage payment. If one person has additional expenses that are required then they may have less income to put into the joint accounts. This has to be dealt with to some extent. However, you need to understand that not everyone likes to eat at the same time. So why should you be able to eat whenever you want too? You're both working and are entitled to a set income, or a net of costs and income.  If you're each working 40hr plus you can't expect to both have the whole pie. You may want to consider a monthly set amount. The amount each of you get can vary the amount of the cost reduction the other parent got. This type of situation is not uncommon. There are some that might argue that the ""married"" person should get less then the ""not married"" person. There is no ""right"" way of looking at this. A few things can be taken into account though. You're both trying to get through the day. One child doesn't see that the other parent is gone right now as they are too young to understand. Even if they were older, they could see you there when the missing parent is around. You should both be appreciative of the others work and recognize that you are both doing different things at times. There are different ways to appreciate another's efforts. It doesn't mean that you have to have 50/50 split. You can do that but it is harder in these days of the economy. One of you should be paying the full amount of rent or mortgage. The other one can be paying the groceries. If rent and mortgage cannot be shared then you need to discuss other items. There are lots of little things you can save on that will add up. You could divide up 60/40 if you wanted to. Again it is completely up to you. You don't want to be seen as not being equal. Even if you have a different status.  You're both working. You're both paying half the bills. You both are giving up your time to do it. You're both caring for the kids. The kids don't know how much each of you put in. The children are more important than the money at this point. You need to make some kind of arrangement when you're apart.","You're married now.  All incomes are combined for income tax purposes.  There is no need to split up your respective incomes.  That's for unmarried couples only. As to the second question about how to spend/save the money, there are various scenarios.  All you need is to talk it out and agree on the plan.  If one of you is spending the money to cover the expenses that you agreed to split up, it doesn't matter whose money you spent.  You're both responsible for managing your individual lives. For example, if one of you pays a rent and another pays the utilities, it's not a big deal if the one who pays the rent pays the utilities.  However, if you agree on a budget, you should make the budget for the combined income, and make sure that the expenses are distributed according to the budget."
[INST] What are pros and cons of UK Building Societies compared to banks? [/INST],"Building Societies, for the most part, are owned by the shareholders (their customers). A bank is owned by shareholders (their customers) and owners (out-side shareholders usually big players in finance etc). In a B society you might get a say in company policy (voting rights, share prices, etc). In a bank you may not. In a society your dividends are paid by its profits. In a bank your dividends are paid by bank profits from interest charged and fees earned.","It is important to remember that ""Building Societies"" also operate on the interbank money markets to get the funds that they subsequently lend to borrowers. They may also offer certain investments and savings accounts. In these respects they are no different from ordinary banks. But when looking at the accounts, what are the differentiators between ""Buildings Societies"" and ""Banks"". Building Societies generally have a strong ethos towards the individual member, and they are not a member of the FTSE 100. In some cases they are not a member of the FTSE 250. As such, unlike some of the major banks they do not need to constantly raise further funding for lending. Because a ""Building Society"" is owned by its members i.e. ordinary people and not some faceless corporate beast, so the board of directors of a ""Building Society"" can be directly elected by members. In addition certain Building Societies do not run branch networks. Instead they have a local presence in the community by way of a network of ""Branches"". A branch will still offer many of the services offered by a bank whilst at the same time retaining the ""Building Society"" ethos. Banks need to pay a lot of money in Corporate taxes, which is a key source of income for the govenment. Conversely, ""Building Societies are only required to pay a much lower level of tax on their profits. If you do not want to be part of the corporate machine whilst at the same time wish to retain a connection with your local community, then a ""Building Society"" may be a viable option for you. A Building Society has a much smaller cost base, particularly in terms of costs in terms of marketing, which in turn allows it to pay a higher rate of interest on savings and offers better mortgage rates. It is important to note that just because you are dealing with a ""Building Society"" that you are no longer covered for example by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) or by the Financial Ombudsman Service. You can read more about the FSCS online. Building Societies are not required to hold capital of the size expected by the Bank of England. These days most banks are well aware that there is a cost associated with retaining their customer base. As such it is reasonable to expect that they will offer some perks to those who stay with them to ensure customer loyalty. Examples of these perks includes the paying of loyalty bonuses for sticking with them for a certain period. Others include paying certain premiums to existing customers who agree to take more products from them. Building Societies on the other hand do not enjoy the luxury of this sort of funding."
[INST] What taxes are assessed on distributions of an inherited IRA? [/INST],"When you pass away, the assets in your retirement accounts must be distributed to your heirs. Some people say that by putting money in a retirement account, you are transferring wealth without taxation of the money while it is in the account. And that is true; while it is in your retirement account, no income tax is paid on the earnings it makes. That said, you must pay income tax on the distribution when you take it out. So, if while in your account the money doubles, and you withdraw it, you owe tax on both the principal and the doubled amount, even though you only put in the principal to start with. Also, there may be taxes on the withdrawal itself if you are 59 ½ or younger when you take the money out. There are ""penalties"" involved for withdrawing the money too soon, and for taking out too much at once. There are also rules that if you are making any payments on a liability of any sort at the time of your death, the interest on the loan that was accruing up until that point does not have to be included in the distributions to the beneficiaries. Also, the way you set up your estate plan and how you set up your beneficiaries may determine who (or what) the IRS views as beneficiaries in some cases. For example, if you had your retirement account and a bank account, and you died without establishing a living trust, and your spouse was not the sole beneficiary of your retirement account, then your spouse may have to pay income tax on  a distribution of your retirement account. There are also ways to set this up so that this does not happen. For example, if you wanted to bequeath 50% of your assets to your children, and the other half to your spouse, and you didn't set that up via a Living Trust or Last Will and Testament, the IRS will have the final say in the matter. You should consult an attorney who specializes in estate planning. Good luck.","It will be a normal rollover so no tax will be due when the new account is opened.  But you should keep in mind that you will owe income tax on any of the earnings that you transfer to the new account that were subject to tax at your original basis.  You will not owe any tax on the contributions, but only on the earnings. You may wish to consider transferring only the needed funds and waiting a while to open the account because you will no longer be subject to the annual contribution limits.  The money contributed to an IRA account is considered a gift and so you may only contribute a total of $100,000 as a gift to your father each year. If the account is in the name of the father as a custodial IRA, you could contribute at any time when the father would qualify as a minor without exceeding your gift tax exclusion."
[INST] How to diversify IRA portfolio given fund minimum investments and IRA contribution limits? [/INST],"I'll preface my statements by saying that you have to decide what your investment strategy is. Your strategy then controls how you diversify. If you're going to buy and hold for the long-run, then the only diversification decision is how much (in % or in dollars) of your retirement savings you want to put in stocks vs bonds. If you're going to take a more active strategy, meaning you actually take an asset class out or in, then you'll need to decide how you want to do that; rebalance, buy on price weakness, or another method.  IRA accounts provide a lot of flexibility in that regard. I agree whole heartedly with @littleadv's answer on investment methodology: You need to know WHY you're investing and then find the right instrument, no the right index fund (ETFs/mutual funds are fine as long as they represent a single asset class).","While the question was not specified as being directed at only a ROTH IRA or only a Traditional IRA, it will be assumed that it was not targeted as the ""Roth is the better match.""  To diversify your Roth IRA portfolio given fund minimum investments and IRA contribution limits, you will need to understand, first, that there is no single ""best"" IRA. If you maxed your annual IRA contribution limit, you can open a second IRA account in another form.  If you are near or just surpassed the Social Security income thresholds for your filing status (single or married), you may consider Roth IRA, SEP IRA or SIMPLE IRA. But only if your income is too high, or if you are self-employed.  An IRA is not the only way to invest for retirement, but it should be your starting point if you do not have access to a workplace retirement plan.  There are other types of IRAs that can help you diversify. A traditional IRA can provide diversification on a tax-deferred basis, while a Roth IRA can provide diversification on an after-tax basis and give you more investment choices later if you qualify for ""Early Withdrawals.""  In general, I would not recommend a Roth 401K for your retirement, given the higher fees that may be charged in employer-sponsored retirement plans.  However, it is not always cut and dried about what funds to use, so, you need to understand all of your options, costs, fees and penalties.  An Employee Stock Option plan is not a retirement plan. If you have this option, and have the opportunity, you are better off diversifying that money, and not your own money invested in your company. You will also need to understand that once you have invested into tax-deferred accounts, you can no longer claim deductions for contributions to a Traditional IRA.  You can't keep adding money into tax-defered programs once you have reached 70.5 years old. And in retirement, you have to pay taxes on earnings in tax-deferred accounts, as well as, taking Required Minimum Distributions from an IRA each year (although RMDs do not apply to employer-sponsored retirement programs).   The IRS makes the Roth better than the Traditional. It is not a free lunch as they do limit annual deposits to IRA accounts."
[INST] What does Capital Surplus mean? [/INST],"Capital surplus is the amount of funds in excess of capital required, i.e. the equity.  On the liability side surplus is net assets.  This can be used to add or subtract by the board as it desires, although any subtraction will have to be ratified by a general meeting.   The amount of additional funds allowed to be added to the capital surplus is set forth by law.","Surplus is the portion of income/cashflow that has been set aside for unexpected costs such as new investments, maintenance costs, etc. Companies often keep a portion of their revenue, so the balance sheet can have many classifications for capital. Surplus or reserves is what is kept for future costs, retained earnings represents money that is to be distributed to shareholders, etc. Depending on how the company is organized, this may also be called retained earnings. If this portion of the balance sheet is not explicitly indicated, it may be a classification issue -- that is the company may have made another error, and they should revise their classifications."
[INST] moving family deposits away from Greece (possibly in UK) [/INST],"You can hold large amounts of cash ""under the mattress"" for an extended period of time.  Just pay for all bills, like rent, taxes, utilities, etc. using credit.  The only way you get robbed or defrauded in this situation is if someone knows your credit cards or your account numbers.  The way many people choose to stash cash like this used to be to place it under your own mattress.  In the interest of not losing one's money to a fire or home break-in or robbery, some people store it separately and some people still use home burglar alarm systems to protect their goods. Some people who had larger sums of money would use a bank vault or a lock box in a safety deposit box.  If you store money at a bank, however, you have to consider that the bank may decide to freeze your assets due to ""suspicious activity"", even if it's entirely legal, as the US government may freeze your bank accounts due to an alleged ""link"" between your activities and those of a company or individual the US government suspects of being a terrorist or working for a hostile foreign government. You simply cannot withdraw all of your money without first finding another secure offshore storage system.","The big question you're asking is ""Should we leave Greece now or wait and see what happens?"". The answer to that depends on many things, one big factor being your situation, what other countries you have ties to, what other countries you can get into the country (and can exit it), have you/your family been involved in any illegal work or money laundering or other illegal activity, etc, etc... To get the best info you're going to have to put in a fair amount of work yourself at finding out the best answers for your situation. It's not up to us here to tell you everything there is to know, because if we did we'd be giving out misinformation and bad advice - after all we don't know who is reading and we don't know your situation.

"[INST] What should I do with my $10K windfall, given these options? [/INST]","Do you like traveling? If so, there's very little wrong with giving yourself the option of not having to worry about debt collectors. Get them paid off, build a small emergency fund, learn to budget. Then you can go back to saving up for something like paying off your car.","Given how you want to invest in a house (i.e. you view $20k as a down payment) and are currently living in a situation where you have to pay rent that you can no longer afford (and therefore have a very low emergency fund), it would seem that you could make a good case for using most or all of the money as a down payment and thus lowering your monthly payment.  That would allow you to increase your emergency fund, while lowering your overall living expense.  It would also give you the greatest amount of leverage into the rest of the real estate market as it would likely grow at the same rate as the market.   I recommend making a plan with specific goals.  Decide how much money you want to have in your emergency fund.  This is going to depend a little on how close to retirement you are and your overall financial situation.  Most advisers suggest having 8-12 months of ""living expenses"" saved in a savings account.  You could save that, and then use that as a guideline for how much to put in to a CD or some other safe investment option for your emergency fund.   To illustrate this process, using the 12 month guideline suggested by some, at $10k per year you could have your emergency fund built up in approximately 2 years of living on the additional income available with the current market rates for a 30 year mortgage.  This assumes that you keep you current expenses the minimum as currently suggested, which would be a good idea anyway as you probably don't have much wiggle room.  If you have a better idea of the average market rate for real estate in your area, you could do some calculations to see how good a deal the $20k down you have can get you in that market and see if that number should be used for your ""emergency fund"".   Another option you could do is to pay your credit cards down to  low balances (less than $3k), get a better rate with a single credit card, and use it as an emergency fund, with the understanding that you will pay it off at the $20k down-payment rate assuming that it does not rise over that amount again.  This would allow you to borrow the lowest amount of money possible, while still allowing you the convenience of a credit card for emergencies or emergencies.  It will also minimize the effect of rising rates on your monthly payments.  The other downsides of this option are, of course, that you will have less of a buffer in times of emergency, the interest rates on your credit card will likely be higher, and your overall payment may be higher due to the ""over-payment"" on the credit card balance.

[INST] Saving up for an expensive car [/INST],"First off, don't get a brand new car. That is a sure fire way to waste a lot of money up front only to lose up to 50% within just a few years.  What is the car for? If it is for your daily commute, get something small that gets good gas mileage and is reliable. Otherwise you will be throwing money down a rat hole of maintenance and gas. If it is part of a plan to move into a different lifestyle (i.e. starting a family, becoming a commuter), think about practicality first and foremost, and if money is a driving factor in that (e.g. you do not want to spend much on maintenance), look at getting something like a Volvo S60, which have low maintenance costs and use the very fuel efficient turbo Diesel engines of Mercedes. If you are just looking for a sports car that is fast and fun, then you probably want to think hard about buying a used car if you are young, and definitely, if you are in your twenties. Buy a newer car that is only a few years old (under 20k km on the odometer) that has already had the first few big maintenance costs (changing transmission fluid and the 90k km or 50k mile service interval) already done. Also, make sure to get a certified pre-owned or dealer-serviced history report for any vehicle you are looking at. If the vehicle has a history of accidents, it will probably be considered scrap. However, if it has had a major repair, especially with a warranty like the Audi 3 year 80k warranty, it can be a good buy. The maintenance and minor repairs may be an ongoing cost, but a year or two of regular payments can be a good way to get the vehicle without the new car price. It can also give you some experience with the vehicle to see if some of the costs are worth it. Otherwise, you are going to be blindsiding yourself financially and may end up with a bad experience.  If the vehicle is for work and a new car is the only option to get work done, then consider what type of work you will be doing. If it is purely driving and taking people around (i.e. you drive, but no other vehicle operation), get a small, practical car with more horsepower, not more torque: the more power, the less likely for transmission failures. If you have to tow, get a low mileage car that is more towing oriented (e.g. heavy-duty diesel trucks, SUVs or convertibles with towing equipment) and ensure all the regular maintenance is being performed. If you have to drive in city traffic, look for more fuel efficient alternatives like a Hybrid or Diesel.  Whatever type of car you are looking at, it is critical to understand your needs and use those needs to set expectations, look for solutions, and make rational selections (i.e. based on facts and not emotions for the sake of feeling special) that are sensible and economical. Then your goal of having a large amount of money saved for a car is much easier to achieve, because a significant amount of that money saved will already go towards other items like maintenance, insurance, fuel, repairs, etc.","You're young and have your whole life ahead of you. You also have responsibilities and are earning an income. Your current vehicle gets you from point 'A' to point 'B', if it breaks down buy a used Ford Windstar. A used one in good working condition will not cost much, and you can pick one up at the dealership, or find one while on your way to work. As far as upgrading your vehicles you may want some advice. First you say this year you plan to buy ""brand new"" I must assume you mean this year, but what do you mean? Do you mean buy the car and drive it until the end of the year, or mean buy the car now, do the upgrades and make it ready for next year? Buying a brand new vehicle year after year is not frugal. Yes you may want the latest and greatest gadgets but they will not last forever. If you get a year old car you can still have warranty, with less depreciation and if sold when you are ready to upgrade your investment should provide some profit. Another option is buying a car with many miles and making simple upgrades. The value of the car will most likely increase and when you are ready for the newer car your old car should have increased in monetary value.  There is nothing wrong with having a car with more miles, there are a lot of reasons why the owner is selling it. If it is priced right it's a good purchase. And do keep in mind that you need to save this money, not borrow it. Borrowing will get you further into debt and can be a slippery slope."
[INST] Why should one only contribute up to the employer's match in a 401(k)? [/INST],"An earlier poster noted that there are two reasons why you would only want to contribute up to the employer match.  I mentioned the tax reduction that comes from doing so.  The other reason to make sure that you are getting the employer's entire match is that matching contributions are free money.  They aren't even subject to FICA withholding.  That's an extra 3% that your employer will match, but you might still owe an additional 7.65% in FICA taxes.  (If you're self-employed rather than an employee, you have to pay that yourself, of course.  But self-employed means that you can deduct half the total in your taxes, which effectively lowers the employer/employee portion from 15.3% to 7.65% that we have to pay with payroll deduction.) If you're at the maximum that will reduce your taxes, then you'll want to contribute enough to get the match.  If you're not contributing the maximum match, then you'll be paying taxes on that money you're not getting matched. If you're already maxing out your employer match, then there is no additional tax benefit to contributing beyond the employer match.  But, if you are not going to spend the money you save through tax deductions, then you're still getting a benefit of saving the money pre-tax.  For example, I max out my contributions to my 401k, which I do by contributing an extra 3% of my pre-tax salary in addition to the 2% paid in by my employer.  My employer match is a 100%, but only up to the first 2% of my salary.  So, if I were to max out my employer match, my 401k deposits would only equal ~1.25% of my salary, and I would max out even if my employer stopped contributing.  If I were simply contributing to get the employer match, I'd be saving 2x my salary each year, but still only have deposited 1.25x my salary.  The other 75% of my contribution each year would be paid in taxes.  Even if you think you'll need all that money before retirement, there can still be benefit to saving, rather than spending it, because of inflation.  The money you're saving now might not be worth any more by the time you use it in your 50s or 60s, 70's or 80's.  And you might get into a situation when you're unable to make contributions.  For example, after having my first child, my household income went down, so did my employer's contribution to my 401k.  And, of course, there is the benefit of being forced to save during a period when you might otherwise spend money unnecessarily.","There are many reasons why a person should not contribute more than their employers contribution. First, some 401(k) plans feature a maximum contribution limit. (I believe that the number is 15%, subject to an income limit of $220K or so.) Many people do not need assistance in meeting this goal. Second, some people may be unwilling to pay investment expenses higher than what they could get in a taxable account. Some may have investments that they value more than the tax deduction. Third, some employers have special deals to get additional contributions from a participant. Most notably, some will match a personal contribution up to 10%. This feature alone is better than any advice you will receive from your company's plan.   Fourth, some folks find they actually need the liquidity during times of financial pressure. Sometimes you need the cash. Sometimes. However most times the contribution will be a smart move to take advantage of higher earning capacity and tax advantages. To quote Vanguard's website, The 401(k)"" is like a savings account that grows tax deferred and is available to you only at age 59½. It has several advantages over other retirement plans. Your total contribution limit to 401(k) plans depends on your age. Your employer can choose to limit individual contributions to between $4,000 and $16,500 in 2008."""
[INST] 30% share in business [/INST],"You have already got a lawyer involved to do some basic research. He's doing his job well. When you say you've taken a 30% position in the company, do you mean that you've taken a 30% interest as well as a 30% of management? If you're 30% of management in an LLC, your shares may need to be 2.6% (at least) to have the same voting power. LLCs typically allow their members to choose the equity distribution, and you may want to review the agreements and how the equity has been distributed. If you are a member of the LLC, the LLC itself will have to pay taxes on income distributed to you. If you pay yourself a salary, that's a different issue since the business may be able to write off some operating expenses and the salary won't be taxed until it's distributed personally. Again, read your agreements and talk to your lawyer. You said your role in the company is to get capital to fund acquisitions and then managing these acquisitions. This likely involves your being a director or officer in the business--which usually means being a member but at a fixed percentage. The distribution agreements are not likely to be made public at this time.","In order to be considered a business, you need to have an operational and economic purpose.  You need to demonstrate that you have a business plan, can forecast some cash flow, and have evidence that your plan will be successful (a track record for getting people to part with their money).  You must also demonstrate that you can do business without any outside financing/shareholder's capital/receivables/debt etc (or at least show that this is the eventual plan).  If you have a business then it is your choice what to do with it.  This is true in most companies.  If you want your partner to buy you out, then set the terms so that there is no confusion about the terms of the deal.  If you do not come to any agreement that means he can do whatever he wants with his own share.  It is hard to say what is fair.  He may want to hold onto the shares forever and be content with no cash for them in the mean time or he may want cash now.  At the end of the day, it is a negotiation that will lead to cash for you or not.  If you are willing to hold onto the equity in the company and put your fate in the hands of the business then you may be able to get him to buy you out in cash.  That could simply mean a large cash buy out payment or it could mean a series of small payments."
[INST] Can I use FOREX markets to exchange cash? [/INST],"I think I have found a different option, I will make them an offer to sell me the money at the current FOREX rate, if the FOREX rate is above the 4% fee on their card then they would save money by taking one of my coins. So they could be saving themselves a lot of money in fees if they were willing to use the FOREX market in some way. Also there is no need to use banks in the equation as they can be taken out altogether. I am happy to give a market price, but what if they refuse to sell me cash? I was wondering if I could do this with any foreign country and which currency would be best for me to get the most cash for? I like the idea of giving coins for cash, and I also think the market would be a place where they could sell their coins for cash without losing too much to the exchange rate. This FOREX solution does not involve banks so it is another solution to this problem that uses the market.","Yes, although there are some issues with accessibility for your purposes. First, there is not a centralized exchange for currency like there is for stocks or commodities. Most currencies are traded through a decentralized network of banks, and even currencies in the form of ""cash"" have some degree of centralized control. Second, although you can theoretically create an account with any broker and purchase currency for a wire transfer, the fees may be outrageous because of the nature of foreign exchange transactions. Third, the banks would require you to have a credit history and/or other paperwork to open an account in their system. Although this won't be an issue for you, it's worth noting that this is a way for the banks to determine account history and other financial data to support legal requirements. Fourth, most currency ""cash purchases"" at currency trading desks require you be in possession of the cash you seek to exchange. Since you wouldn't have any currency, it's not likely you can get them to transfer that way. There's no central body which requires banks to accept currency purchases as there is for stock purchases. Lastly, currency purchases at banks and other currency offices will not be honored when you attempt to spend the currency overseas. Some of these will be accepted at currency exchanges or the bank branches which accept them, but not all will."
[INST] Considering investing in CHN as a dividend stock [/INST],"CHN makes money by selling groceries. Not very complicated. Like any other business, there's always risk associated with that, but its business can only go as far as the number of people who need to buy groceries. While I don't know exactly how their costs, margins, etc. are, I would have a hard time seeing it being a stable dividend payer - unless they're using some of the cash they raise to go buy other companies with more stable dividends. What does CHN do with its cash? From their year end report, they say ""As a result, total debt and net debt were NOK 334.2 million at 31 December 2010, compared to NOK 678.5 million in 2009."" Now, that might be interesting - since they just announced their last earnings report this month, they could have just used the money used to pay this dividend for reducing the debt they took on to pay the dividend for the previous earnings period. (This would lead me to think that maybe they had a large reduction in their inventory value, but you would think that would be reflected in the share price - the share price dropped to about $41 a share from $50+ when earnings were released - that's about a 20% drop.)","Dividends don't mean anything. I mean that seriously. I'll be 60 in two months and I can't say that I've ever gotten a dividend check and thought, ""well, that worked out, now that was worth it!"". Dividends (and dividend yield) are only meant to entice you to stay with a company. I don't know why CHN pays dividends as it's clearly in trouble in regards to its debt. A debt to earnings ratio of 6x does not a good investment make (I don't know how to insert a table in comments but just google it). As to your question as to whether it's an appropriate option to hold, it's my opinion that dividend yield means very little. It's what a stock does with your money that ultimately will make you or break you. So in terms of value, it's more important to look for a company that is solid and sound as the value of its shares will be based on the fundamentals rather than some sort of dividend yield and/or ratio to market cap. Again, I'm not a fan of CHN, but if it's a solid company then I suppose there's no harm looking at it though if its fundamentals are suffering, you may be looking at even more dividend cuts in the future. If I could offer any advice, it would be this: if you don't know much about the company you're investing in, then look elsewhere. That's going to be your biggest hurdle as a dividend investor. The more you know about the company, the better your chances will be of making a wise investment decision."
[INST] Getting financial advice: Accountant vs. Investment Adviser vs. Internet/self-taught? [/INST],"98% of people do not do the things that are going to really benefit them financially over the long term. If you want a different result, you need to do something different than the crowd is doing. It'll save you a lot of money if you avoid the advice of the crowd. Here's some places to save: 1.) You can open and maintain your own savings account. If you know how to do it properly. The first rule: Keep at least 15-20% of your income in cash or highly liquid money market savings account. It's what can help you out if an emergency situation occurs, and you need to pay medical bills, car repairs, etc. (not including school tuition). The purpose of a savings account is to have an emergency fund in case of an emergency, not as a piggy bank to finance your day to day expenses (that's the purpose of the 401(k) and / or an IRA or pension plan). This is a myth with many Americans, and one of the main reasons why most Americans cannot afford the cost of the basics, such as health insurance, retirement, etc. And yes its possible to save this amount, even with a family (if you choose to do it). My wife and I both work. We both make good money, but because of our life styles, it feels like we can save more than most. And we get an attitude adjustment from some of our friends in the process (who will call us cheap skates for not spending our money on toys). It's part of my financial plan, which includes 6 main goals for what I will strive to accomplish with the money I make: 1.) Save a minimum of $10,000 annually for an emergency fund. 2.) Save $215 a month to be able to fully take advantage and open up a retirement plan. 3.) Save enough to support my wife and I, in our older years, if we reach 90 or older.  4.) Create a fund that can help provide education for our children. 5.) Create a fund of excess income that can provide a stable foundation for our children, grandchildren and their children with financial assistance in times of need. 6.) Reduce my total debt, so I can have the income to fully accomplish items 1, 2, & 3.) I'm not a super saver, and I don't come from money, but I know this can work. But you must be able to keep it a secret from your friends and relatives. Because people will try and drag you back down to their level, or make it out that your crazy for having money saved for retirement. So, you'll have to work on yourself and learn, so that you can change your attitude and your plan to better accommodate your lifestyle and needs for the future. 2.) You do not need to invest in the stock market to save for an emergency fund. That's another myth. Investing is long term wealth building. Saving is for building an emergency fund, so you have some liquid assets available. There are numerous bank/s and investment plans available that'll get you an interest rate that's higher than 1% or so, but they have terms. To have a really good savings plan, you'll have to stay at least a year or 2, if you can. However, I have a simple saying: Saving money is for living without debt, investing is for the long term. 3.) The stock market's great! But why should I choose to invest? What are the benefits? Should I do it? I've invested in some money funds and retirement accounts, because it seemed to be the right thing to do. But it took some time for me to figure out that I was being financially manipulated to invest. As I've stated before, it's just like a casino. They have ways to ""fix"" the games, so that you'll lose. Even Warren Buffett agrees. He doesn't really invest his money in the stock market. He invested in low cost banks and he invests his money into companies that he knows the inside and out of. However there are other reasons to invest in the stock market.  A.) It's a way to buy and own a portion of a company without having to invest capital for the entire company. B.) This can allow a company to raise money, so it can expand, or finance new growth strategies, without having to liquidate all its assets. And if it goes wrong, it could very well fail and you'll lose your investment. C.) It can generate income that provides dividends  and interest to it's investors. Which can","First, as @user58212 pointed out, getting advice from people with proven track-records is almost always the best route to go. Most people don't know what they're doing, and many of them have no interest in learning.  However, you're asking about the cost of such advice.  As you may have heard, even the best stock pickers can't reliably beat the market.  The stock market itself provides consistent returns, as long as you stick to your investment plan over time.  I'd suggest you check the Bogleheads wiki, it's an outstanding guide to low-cost, tax efficient investing.  Here are some highlights:  Invest in low-cost index mutual funds in your employer' plan  Diversify by using your age as a starting point, and adjust it slightly based on your risk tolerance.  You can diversify even more without having to pick individual securities.  (Some of the investment advisors/counselors/planners out there would prefer you to pay them to pick these investments for you when they can't reliably beat the market anyway – take anything you hear about ""rebalancing"" with a grain of salt.)   Keep an eye on tax efficiency by keeping your taxable dividends and capital gains inside tax-advantaged accounts if you're taxed at a higher rate otherwise.  Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s (if available) are the way to go; contribute up to the limit. Stick to these basics, and you'll save yourself lots of money, while doing a good job of saving and investing. Keep your investing simple, and you'll understand where your money goes and why.  For example, ""the market"", ""the benchmark"" or ""my portfolio"" are useful, understandable words to use (and a good place to start).  They're very useful references.  Contrary to much of what you may hear about investment advisors, those labels are very useful from the point of view of someone who doesn't understand all the investing acronyms – and the more you understand, the easier it will be for you to pick a simple, cost-effective investment strategy."

[INST] why do I need an emergency fund if I already have investments? [/INST],"As a rule of thumb, I recommend that people have a large enough emergency fund to meet their needs for about six months. If you've already met that level and are comfortable with how much you have in your investment accounts, that's great. However, your situation is not what might happen to most of us. Consider the following: We've already established that you have other people in your life that make it more difficult to build and maintain an emergency fund. Unfortunately, many situations conspire to undermine one's emergency fund. In an emergency, you would have to sell the investment at that time. That means that you would be potentially selling it for a loss. In effect, you may be selling for less than you have invested, which negates one of the key benefits of the emergency fund.  If you can comfortably make the trades, then I think that you should continue with your current plans. I don't know exactly what is happening in your market. The reason for keeping the emergency fund money is to help cover these types of emergencies. If everything goes smoothly, that's great. Just make sure you're prepared in case it does go wrong.","Your savings will be called upon when it comes time for your first house down payment, and to help you get by at some point in your career change. I don't have the exact data handy on the age/stage of family household that typically starts saving for their first house, but its something in the order of 10-15 years. You must consider that in that time inflation, your mortgage, and your other expenses will change (kids, car, etc), so you must plan for that.  You will want a downpayment of around 20% of the price of your house. You can borrow a bit for condos sometimes, but it will lower the amount of house you can afford, so I say at least 20%.  Then you'll also want to save for a 'move in' expense like painting, carpet, and so on, to the tune of maybe 15% of the house value, or maybe 40% of the down payment  If you are going to sell, you'll have to pay real estate agent fees (in some circumstances it's worth it for the seller to pay, but in this case it would be the buyer paying the fees). There might also be closing costs associated with your mortage, a survey, and a home inspection (especially if it's older).  It's worth it though, to keep your cashflow positive, and to stay motivated throughout the savings cycle, so if you're a conservative investor, then keep the emergency fund."
[INST] What financial data are analysed (and how) to come up with a stock recommendation? [/INST],"As for the methodology, I don't know if HSBC will release this info in public. My best guess is it will be a proprietary method combining the old and the new methodologies. It probably includes fundamental analysis (income statement and balance sheet), technical data (charts and patterns) and market sentiment (volume and short interest).","The primary input of the algorithm I helped to develop was the daily return rate (net of dividends, fees & broker's spread):  r = R(t+1) - R(t) Thus the objective of the analysis was to answer a simple question:  t = 0  R(0) --->   R(k) = R(0) + r   ...   R(t) r1 r2 ...    rk For which the most obvious answer is: R(k) = log[R(0) * (1+r)...(1+rk)]  k = 1 ...  220 If the return rate is a random variable, then so is R(k), and hence R(k+1) = R(k) + r(k+1) is also a random variable and hence r(k+1) is a random variable ... and so on up to time 220 when each R(i) and r(i) has a well observed value, and one can plot the random walk (and possibly fit a curve to it). The daily return rate, r is defined as:  r = ln[R(t+1)/R(t)] where R(t) is given, and R(t+1) is to be estimated from a model to be determined. That is how my analysis worked, and it is the answer to your first question.  As to the algorithms, there are a large number of statistical models one could use to fit an estimate to R(t+1). My choice was the model that proved to be the best in terms of accuracy, and it was based on a GARCH(1,1) process plus a linear regression. I called the algorithm ""Forecasts and Valuation"". It was published in April, 2010 in the Journal of Trading. The first article to explain the method, with more technical detail, was published in 1995 (in the Journal of Futures Markets). My other articles on the algorithm, if you wish to dig deeper into the details: For the second question, you asked: How I estimate the return rate and which algorithm does estimate that? In the above formulation for r(t+1) one needs to provide a model for R(t) with a set of parameters K,  where R(t) is a (k x 1) vector of stock prices, and r(t+1) is the daily return rate for t=0 ... 220, as an (n x 1) vector for n = 2 to 220. For example, to estimate R(t) = [R_1(t) R_2(t) ...   R_n(t)]':  = (1/q^n-1) * [R_1(t+1) R_2(t+1) ... R_n(t+1)]': This is the method published in the 1995 article, and the choice of parameter q is 0.07. Other choices are also possible. The model for R(t) is defined by the set of parameters K. This model includes n of the stock prices r to be analysed. With a large n, it is possible to estimate daily mean and variance for each of the n stocks with each update and the update the previous estimates as new data arrives. Note that the model is a function of both R(t) and R(t+1) to be described in terms of a matrix of parameters K. Thus the algorithm is:  Update R(t+1) = [R_1(t+1) R_2(t+1) ...   R_n(t+1)]': Then, update R(t) =  [R_1(t) R_2(t) ...   R_n(t)]': Finally, using R(t) and (new) R(t+1), update r = [r_1(t+1) r_2(t+1) ... r_n(t+1)]': and then also update the parameters K_i in the linear regression part of the algorithm. To be specific, on the first day, one only knows the current R(t), and can only estimate r(t+1) by the past history of R(t). So first one forecasts r(t+1) then next day one observes r(t+1) and updates R(t), and then again forecasts r(t+2); hence the word ""forecast"".

If they do not automatically credit your trading account from which you bought the units, then you should contact your broker and request a cheque credit or automatic rollover to your trading account (if it is a new fund you bought, it is very likely that you'll be credited a cheque by the company itself). Otherwise, you'll have to redeem your units back to the fund company which may entail an additional cost (unless the fund company you just bought the units from manages the new fund for which you have received some units, rollover to your account is usually free if it does). You simply cannot redeem the units you've received unless you want to sell them (and unless it is possible for the distributor/manager to convert the new units into old units and add them to the existing share holding you have). If you want to receive additional dividends/fund equalisation/bonuses (i.e.: if you wish to increase your holding) you'd have to buy new units which will be again added to your existing holding or exchange the dividend bonus/fund equalisation cheque(s) you've received for additional new units.",Funds pay out a portion of investment gains as dividends and reinvest the rest into securities.  These dividends come from realized gains (i.e. selling securities held for less than they were purchased for) and from dividends paid by securities the fund owns. The portion of investment gains reinvested is called the Fund's Tangible Net Assets.  The Fund's performance is primarily evaluated on the growth of these assets.
[INST] Is Cash Value Life Insurance (“whole life” insurance) a good idea for my future? [/INST],"Some things to consider: Your question seems to assume that the reason you are paying $151/mo is ""good"" for you. You said the goal is that one day you won't be paying it. A question to consider is ""is this really a good thing for me right now?"". It is very possible you might have enough insurance already. Most of what you are paying is going to cover the ""whole life"" side of things: the cash value part. This means that the death benefit will actually be very small, and likely will not cover the debt you have. It is unlikely you will ever see that death benefit unless you die while your kids are still in college. This is not to say you should just drop the insurance. You should review your needs, and then make smart decisions based on what your life situation is.","It is not a good idea, financially, to sell a life insurance policy, even while it's in force, unless that sale is at its total cash value including the face amount.  While the face amount and the cash value may well be ""tied in"" together, as they often are, there is no guarantee that this will be so, or that there is any residual cash value at all, at any time other than when they are both zero. As JoeTaxpayer said: The point of buying some of this stuff is for the cash value, yes, but the cash value grows slowly and only becomes available for withdrawal, typically, via policy loans.  If you decide to surrender the policy, you'll get some but not all of the cash value back (the surrender charges will reduce the amount you get, and those may be substantial).  If you fail to pay premiums, the insurance company will keep some of your money and cancel your policy.  If you cash in the policy too soon, you won't receive all of your dividends (those go to the company, not you), nor will you receive all of your cash value (again, the surrender charges will reduce the amount you receive).  If you continue paying the premiums, chances are good that some of your money will be spent on your premiums, fees, and taxes that the insurance company can't deduct as a cost of doing business.  And the last of the money that you don't pay out, or that was returned to you when the policy lapsed, they tax at ordinary income rates, even though it's return of the principal on an investment, and a life insurance agent will tell you it's an investment. I bought life insurance in my mid-twenties on the advice of a well-known financial planner and author.  I paid all of the premiums for several years, paid the additional fees to ensure the policy wouldn't lapse before I died, and eventually paid off the $18,000 of premiums (including the early years' additional costs, just to make sure I would have insurance), which I was guaranteed to get back when I became age 65 and stopped paying premiums.  That would be about 40 years down the road from now.  There were two problems that I couldn't foresee when making that decision, one of which I knew about, and the other of which I didn't.  First, had I known then that I would eventually divorce my husband (I was divorced before age 30, the insurance agent had said that it wouldn't matter if I divorced, which it did),  I wouldn't have bought this policy.  Now, with all of our joint assets split at divorce, I'd only be eligible for half of the face amount of the policy, $50,000.  Second, I never knew that my employer would end its employer-provided life insurance, which would have provided more insurance -- up to perhaps triple the death benefit that the private-market policy I had bought would provide.  And, as I knew when I was making the decision to buy that policy, if I let my employer's policy lapse, there was no way for me to get back to my old premiums.  Now that I would have to pay much higher premiums to buy a new policy, I would have been better off keeping the policy that was sold to me (which, incidentally, was a ""universal"" policy, which I had found confusing when I read about it and when asked to agree to various terms in writing, as all insurance agents will eventually ask you to do).  The second thing I didn't know -- that my financial advisor would, 11 years after I'd been paying premiums and even after they were fully paid, sell that policy to me, offering to buy me out and pay me that cash value, about $8,000 in this case.  The problem with that buyout was that the cash value amount didn't include the face amount, which was well over $30,000, and when I asked about that, my financial planner offered to ""prove me wrong"" by letting me see that the total cash value and the face amount were tied together -- by saying that if I let their company buy me out, they would return the premiums to me by mail, separately, so I could see the total cash value, all together, if I wanted to sell.  I declined to try that test (not knowing that I could do much research on what I'd bought and what I might be able to sell it for or how to estimate if my advisor would be taking his share out"
[INST] Why are there many small banks and more banks in the U.S.? [/INST],"I'm not sure what you mean by ""many small banks"", but the main reason that banks still exist is that we don't actually have a complete banking system in this country... yet.  But we're on our way there and eventually we will, especially as more and more states move towards adopting the laws of California on this topic. The biggest problem with the current system of banking is that banks are currently under federal and state control, and states are required to follow federally mandated banking regulations... even though those regulations aren't always what they should be.  As an example, consider that at the state level, banks are required to limit accounts to 6 withdrawals per month... even though the federal government gives them the right to do more than that. States also have to prohibit the establishment of branches without some sort of official government approval, even though the federal government allows businesses to operate in any state.  I don't recall the actual laws off the top of my head, but the point of a fully federal banking system is to do away with all these regulations and allow us to do whatever we want with our money and the banks that hold it.","The other answer explains how the U.S. banking system differs from the UK & Irish banking systems, but how did the U.S. have almost 2,300 banking institutions when compared to India.  India is also a developing country, has 1.2 Billion more people than the U.S., which should be enough for most services.  The following are five reasons why we have a different size in our banking system:  The first reason is the number of banking institutions are based on the history of the country.  For example, the U.S. has a long history of banking and finance, which started during colonial days, and has grown based on economic needs such as the industrial revolution.  Therefore, the number of states and population could contribute to the number of banks, since there needs to be a bank in every city.  India has a history of credit unions and rural banks which are also different from banks. If there was a large banking consolidation due to the large market, then India would have the same number of banks that we have, which makes me wonder if the credit unions and rural banks still exist after this consolidation. Therefore, it makes sense that the largest developing country with a history of credit in villages, would not only have enough banks for their population, but may have too many for a small economy.  The next two reasons have to do with how the federal government has a different relationship with banks and lending that may increase the supply of banks by comparison to India.  The federal government created the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, which gave the federal government responsibility for creating a central bank while maintaining its independence from the U.S. government.  Therefore, this bank would take on the responsibility of currency, credit, and interest rates as well as some regulatory power.  The central bank also helps keep banks in check in times of financial crisis, which would make consolidation less likely. The United States also has an extensive banking regulation process that is administered by the federal government.  Most banks are state chartered by each state, and then must get some form of approval from the federal government such as a national bank charter from the 1933 Bank Act. Therefore, it makes sense that the U.S. has more banking institutions, since there is more protection by the federal government.  Since these acts were put into effect, the government also created other laws to help protect consumers.  The next two reasons are not part of the federal government history, but explain why banks in the U.S. might be easier to start with less regulation by the federal government. The U.S. has a long history of federal regulation being based on state regulation of banks, and this has allowed states to have their own regulations and requirements.  Therefore, some states have fewer rules and regulations for banks to follow.  In fact, states such as Wyoming don't require banking institutions to have a trust company, depository trust company, or federal bank.  Banks that decide to go to another state have to be regulated within that state while also complying with federal regulations.  At the same time, some banks decide to only do business at a local level so most banks do their business in specific states while offering banking services in that state. Most states have the ability to create new banks while other states don't, which might give banks an incentives to open in states that have this ability.  Since this is part of their business plan, it makes sense that banks would be located in states where they might be able to open more branches in comparison to India."
[INST] Accounting equation: does income really decrease equity? [/INST],"All income will show up eventually in an increase in equity, even if it is from an increase to a reduction in other accounts. Say I start a company.  For my $10,000 contribution, I get equity of $10,000  and liabilities of $10,000 in the form of common and preferred shares, so  $10,000 equity = $10,000 liabilities. In this simple balance sheet the only sources of income that could be from an increase in revenue, or an increase in dividends on the shares.  I decide to pay $1000 in dividends on the preferred stock, and as a result my liabilities go down by $1000, but since this was paid to the shareholders, my revenues have also increased by $1000 - effectively reducing the total equity to $9000. I received $1000 of income, but the increase in revenues reduced my equity.","The income you make does increase your equity but the equation of the double entry system states: Equity = Assets - liabilities. This mean that if I have 100 € but give a loan of 50 € to my neighbor, who does not repay us for 1 year, I cannot use this equation because my assets and liabilities are not equal: Equity = 100 € (assets) - 50 € (liabilities) = - 50 € (assets < liabilities) so my balance sheet is wrong for one year. After the loan, if I can sell something to my friend (for example: you sold me 10 €) so my new balance sheet will be: Assets (110 €) - liabilities (40 €) = equity (70 €)"
[INST] Do I have to pay tax on money I earn as a tutor? [/INST],"In the United States, you are expected to report all earned income, regardless of how you obtain the money, for the year that you earned that money.  If you provided services as a tutor between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016, the year 2016, you will need to include this income on your taxes for 2016.  If you did not report this income for 2016, however, it may be difficult to do so now.  However, the burden of proof that you did not have to report the income for 2016 is on you.   The IRS is only able to audit income for the previous 3 years at any given time.  If you reported the income for the other years (if any), you cannot get in trouble for that.  However, auditing your 2016 income will be problematic because they are not able to audit tax returns for that year yet.  This also means that they are not able to request any of your tax returns for 2016 because they are being prepared to be audited for next year.  However, if you received a letter stating that your tax return has been randomly selected for an audit, you will most likely be able to postpone the audit for one year when they begin auditing your 2016 taxes. The IRS will attempt to audit you under the assumption that you knew how to report your tax information, so you probably will have to submit your own statements about your earnings.   If you can prove that the money you received as a tutor was ""underhanded or illicit activity,"" then you will be exempt from paying taxes for the income.  If you can prove that your earnings were ""gifts"" from your parents, you will most likely get that exemption as well.  However, it becomes much more blurry when it involves gifts from a stranger.  In the end, it is better to assume you have to pay taxes on this income in the year that you have earned it.","The first distinction to make is whether you provide your own resources (e.g. books, worksheets, etc., whether digital or physical) that you own, or whether you use the School's resources (like the textbooks). In many educational settings, you are not allowed to use your own materials. If that is the case, you aren't paying for the resources that you are taking home and using on your clients. You are getting paid for the time invested in researching, preparing and editing the lessons, and the time spent actually teaching the student. As long as the student is a minor, you will have to pay taxes for that work. You will also have to pay taxes on anything you purchase to be used in the tutoring sessions."
[INST] Question about protecting yourself from company not beating earning eastimate [/INST],"Your account doesn't really allow you to lose more than you deposit but, to cover you during an unplanned loss, you need to put money into a margin account. The stock has a market price at any given instant.  So one company could drop while another climbs.  If you want to make money from investments,  what happens after you make a purchase is something you need to think about.   A stock at $10 can make the next stop $8.  So can a stock at $98,  And sometimes a stock keeps dropping.  It can stop at 0.02.  But how many 0.02s do you have to buy before you are comfortable about a particular drop?   On the flip side, at any point you could sell on any price you want.  So the worst case is, you bought for $8 and sell at $9.00 - you've made money while the price continues to drop further.   So you need to be able and prepared to make that decision.  How else should you protect yourself?  Your account balance. That's not the whole story.  The question needs to be asked what is the next stock to invest in at any given time in terms of risk and return.  That stock needs consideration also.  It might be that after an event there is nothing to invest in.  You are left holding a stock which is prone to continued drop.","You're concerned because they're likely to be penalized under that option, and you don't want your options penalized in that way -- in case you do exercise them. They are not likely to be penalized. That penalty will kick in if they report bad earnings in Q2 of the next year, and options still remain outstanding. In fact, the option won't even show up until Q4, which was 2009 in your scenario. So, if you had options -- and you still have shares in the company -- they're likely going to be fine. If the option had become exercisable during that last quarter, you'll receive a tender offer letter. I would recommend that you have your accountant advise you further -- the SEC website has more details on this. What they're doing is called a ""forward-looking statement,"" which is basically telling you they expect to deliver on those projected earnings and revenue levels. It's what analysts are paid to do -- estimate future results for them. It will be interesting to see if Apple follows through with it this time around. It will go down as a very interesting chapter in business history if Apple, the largest company by market cap, reports earnings that fail to beat what they reported last time. It is possible that they are trying to do exactly that -- by saying what they will report next quarter, and getting you to exercise your options and increase their earnings -- all to push the price of the stock higher. To them, you're the customer. It's possible that you don't want to exercise those options if that's indeed the end game. I think you're right to ask, though."
[INST] Gift card fraud: To whom to report? How to recover funds? Is the party which issued me the card liable? [/INST],"The card issuer will be quite happy to know that the recipient is a criminal and to help you in getting your money back. This doesn't mean that the card issuer will take your side, but they will go against the thief's side. So, yes, contact the card issuer immediately.","The question here is how did the cash register get the cash? If the cash came from the cashier, i.e. the register did not have cash in the drawer, then you should report the cashier. The card is the cashier's. However, if cash was already in the drawer, and then the transaction went through so smoothly, then you would be suspect, because cashiers have their cash-out procedures. In that case, I can't say it was your transaction or a different one. If all else fails, you may use credit cards. However, the chances that a store that has not been audited would have the cash it is supposed to have is slim. I hope you can get the money back, at least partially."
[INST] How can one get their FICO/credit scores for free? (really free) [/INST],"My experience has been that ""free trial"" means ""free to sign up, but not free after the trial,"" or even ""not free all during the trial."" I've dealt with various credit reporting agencies, each one sending regular, spammy, ""You've got great credit, buy this service to learn how to keep it up!"" email. Every one so far has billed me despite promising not to. (Of course, if they don't have your bank account information, they can't charge you.) All of these companies have a ""you're-entitled-to-one-request-per-year"" credit report agreement with the federal government that is basically a ruse to get you to sign up for a service they want to sell you.  They're not legally restricted from charging you for a single request, which is free from another source per year (either of them or, if you have a paid subscription, Experian), but they've made that a condition of the other sources selling to you. I will try again the next time I need credit reports to dispute, and will report the results in the comments on this answer.","The easiest way is to get one of those secured credit cards, which require you to deposit cash in advance to guarantee the line of credit.  Once you've gotten the card, use it on some regular bills for one or two months, ideally paying down the balance each month.  Make sure you sign up for the free credit report from one of the credit agencies each of the next three months.  You shouldn't have a great deal of trouble getting a good credit rating with a secured card even if you never make a purchase, just by keeping a balance of several hundred dollars.  I can't think of any other way that does not cost money that will accomplish anything.  The ""no fee"" card often charges a very high interest rate, which works at cross purposes to your objective."
[INST] Where can I find all public companies' information? [/INST],"The easiest way to get this information is to go through a stock quoting application such as Yahoo Finance. There you can search for the company you want including its stock symbol, go to the quotes page for that stock and scroll down to the finacial data. There you can find data about the current financial state of the company including the most recent published annual report. There are also other resources you could use.","For a large number of US/UK equities there is a lot of good information available in the Morningstar Direct database. It does cost money, but the amount you get back for that money is many times what you pay. I used to be responsible for the creation and maintenance of a database of mutual fund information and this database had links to it that pointed to Morningstar for up-to-date information. We also had a database of a lot of securitized debt information, like TBA's and MBS's that we also linked to Morningstar. A lot of what is available from Morningstar is very detailed. For instance, if you wanted to see what percentage of a security is coming due in the next 90 days, a few clicks and a report would be sent to you immediately. You could also look at different categories of stocks and compare them to other categories. One interesting thing that I remember doing was to compare the information on the ADR (American Depositary Receipt) that was publicly available by another company to the information that Morningstar had. It turns out that the other company was in the middle of changing the ADR from the American Stock Exchange to Nasdaq and the information in the Morningstar database was more current."
[INST] Finding Uncorrelated Assets [/INST],"A good way to generate uncorrelated assets is to look at stocks that are in the same industry or sector but are not in the same country.  For example if you bought a stock that was located in Ireland and a U.S. based stock in the same industry you'll have different results if the U.S. has different politics, policies, etc than Ireland. In other words if you're making $100 a year you'll find very different results if you're from Canada versus someone from the U.S.","You are mistaken in the following respect: The returns of a non-diversified portfolio have zero correlation, but this is not the same as saying there is zero risk in a non-diversifiable portfolio. If you bought a few penny stocks, the only diversified way would be to buy one token share of each stock, and in such a miniscule position there would have no correlation, but you would also have no diversification, no money, and no capital gain. It is impossible for you to trade something with little to no correlation to an equity position like the S&P500 for free, since the market itself is perfectly correlated."
"[INST] What does “points” mean in such contexts (stock exchange, I believe)? [/INST]","That's the short version of market capitalization (the number of shares * the share price).   Some markets (like the JSE) prefer to use a multiplier of the 1.000 share price since that's in pence and not pounds, but you see 5,690 ""points"" everywhere now.  The point itself means £10 in this context.  Note that you'll find the numbers here to be slightly different than the ones in, eg, this article. In the UK market, you often see the point used as a shorthand on tickers for the stock's total value. So if the Dow Jones Industrial Average hits 11,487.44 points, that implies a total market value of $1,148,744,400.  The JSE actually uses a different measure, the Alsi 40.  You'll see some interesting numbers.  3,616.93 today.  As always, do some reading on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_index.","It is a measure of the number of times a stock has been traded. At the NYSE, a trade may have multiple exchanges for a stock, if there are multiple market makers for the stock. This count may include multiple exchange and include market makers' and brokers' counter transactions. There are 3 numbers listed in this column, at 2442. These appear to be a moving average that smoothes out some of the peaks and valleys in the price changes. You'd need to contact the exchange for the exact definition."
[INST] I carelessly invested in a stock on a spike near the peak price. How can I salvage my investment? [/INST],"There's only one way to go from a loss to a gain and that's for the stock to go higher.  There's also no reason to think you know any better than the market does what this stock is worth, so it's entirely possible that you can just hold onto it as this company continues its path of increasing and profitable revenue. So long as the underlying company is a good company and growing in revenue and profit margin, the short-term movement of the stock should not affect your long-term wealth.  However, if the company isn't living up to your expectations, and if you honestly understand why, you may want to get out of the stock now while the share price remains high.","If you got bad advice it is called churning when the broker is getting some kick backs and can get into hot water. If you invested without any idea why you don't understand why people invest, then you should learn and then pick something you can stick too like the Total Stock Market Mutual Fund. If you decide you can invest in individual stocks at least understand what you are buying. This means research and then review all the advice."
[INST] Is it possible to improve stock purchase with limit orders accounting for volatility? [/INST],"You are trading a volatile stock, on a volatile market, when volatility is higher than average, and there are a lot of players out there (I could include many more facts but am keeping this short). It's an environment that will encourage the traders around you to use the market as a risk-free instrument, because the ""floor"" created by the buyers is high enough to entice them to place buy orders, especially from the longer term buyers, in fear of missing out. If you had the trading prowess to get the information as soon as the buy volumes spike, that would have been enough for you to have made money, even if your entry price was unattractive, provided you have the confidence in your ability to close the position at a profit - which may not have been realistic then but certainly looked more possible if not guaranteed on the day this question was asked! You are trying to do something that is against the trends at a time in the month where large buy orders are prevalent, then you have some ""special"" price (the latest price you paid) which adds to the cost and limits your sale price, then you are using the tools available that are not suitable (a limit order against your personal preference). You say you are concerned about your opportunity cost and a loss being realised, but if you are that concerned you should only be trading when the longer term fundamentals of the stock give you confidence that the price is undervalued, not when the medium term is being affected by volatility, or in this instance by large companies buying large amounts of stock.","The market maker will see a long stream of limit orders, including yours, and look for customers on the other side that are willing to fill.  They are often using specialized tools to make it quick and easy to manage the queues.  There may be algorithms to automatically reject your request. The simplest such reason might be if the volume is higher than the capacity of their system to process it.  They may have rules to reject such requests. Your broker, like any other business, is usually looking to maximize their margins and limit their risks (such as the risks from shortages), so they too will reject limit orders that push up their costs. The stock exchanges are private entities that can control who can place and fill orders, and generally they will provide tools enabling the market makers to reject orders.  Even the Dot-Coms that attempt to disrupt the stock market don't provide a direct market."
[INST] Tenant wants to pay rent with EFT [/INST],"As they are your tenants, I would imagine you are also the one that is making sure their references and income are checked. If that is the case, and you are still happy for them to move in, then set up the EFT to match their salary dates so that you don't have to pay the banking fees. You can set up an account on your banking system, for each direct payee that you have; that way if you ever lose track of the original EFT details, you could always get it updated.","For the most part you need to follow the procedures outlined in your lease agreement or property management agreement (i.e. where you live, the leasing company has a policy, and that includes how you accept payment). If this person is willing to change, then you could potentially work out a deal, but you'll need to contact the owner or leasing company and negotiate to make sure it is allowed in the first place."
[INST] Can two companies own stock in each other? [/INST],"As described in other answers, it's not a good idea to have shares of one company in the stock of another. But for a small entity like you (you say you run your company from home), it might not be feasible to issue preferred shares and/or corporate bonds, and debt financing could be too expensive. You can't issue bonds for $75,000 - the minimum is $10,000,000 today for a rated offering (that amount might just be the minimum to find investors - the broker might end up charging a fee that is 1% of the amount of money you raise to cover marketing the bond issue). So, you might not have any other option and a reverse merger might be your only option. The important thing to ask yourself is, what are the odds that you will remain in control of your business? This becomes more important if you issue debt. If you default, the bondholders will have the right to demand that the owners be removed.  If you issue preferred shares, that'll be an issue if you need to sell the business. Preferred will have a liquidation preference, so if you sell the business at a loss, the preferred shareholders will get paid prior to the common shareholders. If you own a decent amount of the business (say 50% or more), you might be asked to put up your personal house as collateral to issue the bank debt. But you may not have that amount of equity in your home for pledging. So again, if the odds aren't in your favor, you should weigh your alternatives: a. Sell now and make $1m profit. b. Sell later and make $3m profit. c. Use bank debt, pay a 6% interest rate of $45k a year, issue 8 shares of common stock paying .40c dividend twice a year, and return 50% of profits a year ($.5m), so that your shareholders make a 50% return on their investment a year for 5 years. In this case, you're left with just $150k, which may be what you need to keep your business running (if you sell, you will need to pay taxes on the gain), so, at the end of the 5 years, you may have to sell your house to make a payment on your debt and you may not even sell your business.  You could also try to raise the venture capital, but that may be more than you need. If you need to raise millions again in the future, then consider issuing convertible preferred. That might be simpler. But remember, even at $750k, you will probably have to pay an underwriting fee of $75,000 to raise the money.","Sure they can.

[INST] Are parking spaces and garage boxes a good investment? [/INST],"I don't feel comfortable talking about parking spaces specifically (as the answer is quite a bit different from country to country - especially from region to region).  I wrote an answer on parking spaces on our own blog a year or so back.  Parking spaces are often considered investments because they retain value better than most other investments.  However, most other investments retain value better than parking spaces, and you would have much less hassle in the process. I would only look at investing in parking spaces if they're on a good area, have a very good ROI in terms of rental cash flow, and would appreciate to at least match inflation.  The ""I like this area, I think it's going to be popular"" is not a safe prediction unless you know a lot more than I do.  Also, if I was looking for residential property, I'd be looking for somewhere close to amenities, close to work, good rental income, low expense in terms of rates/management/maintenance, but I would also be looking for potential for capital growth (ie areas gentrifying).  Also, if you're living in the apartment, I'd be quite happy to live in a unit with a garage.  However, if you have two cars in that situation, I'd want to be able to store one on the street to save paying for two garages.","With the cost of a parking space in London you could do so much better in other investments than parking spaces which have only value in one location, unless it was a rare one that might be collectors objects and you have one that might be bought by some collector. There are two things that attract people to consider an investment in parking spaces  Firstly the parking space can in London be a good source of rent as a student may not have other parking spots available to him, but it will only be valuable to those who have a car to park. The fact that people might pay you rent on a one off basis in the future is no guarantee today. But if you can rent it out right now say you pay £ 200 a week which is gross £ 10,400 a year. Your property might have a capital value of say £800,000 which would suggest a rental yield of just 1.25%. Secondly you do not need to worry about it going down a bit. I am not sure that the value will grow if anything it may go down a bit if you take a long run view of housing costs. It is worth knowing in the 1980s an average terraced house in London had only a £50 weekly rental value compared to today £200-£300. In the 1980s the weekly rent was less than the capital cost of the house. So it may be only a way to provide yourself with some cash now and forget about it rather than some investment that is going to make you rich."
[INST] Is it a good investment for a foreigner to purchase a flat/apartment in China? [/INST],"Yes in my opinion, I live there and think it's a great idea and the yuan is on it's way up so will be good to keep in yuan or change over to dollars","The Chinese economy is doing relatively well, so it would seem to be a good time to invest in Chinese real estate. However, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, since the Chinese economy is growing quickly in a number of areas, it is not at all clear what sort of economy is going to prevail five or ten years in the future. I would advise anyone to be careful not to invest all of their assets in one investment (the Chinese economy). It is also important to remember that the Chinese currency, the Renminbi (RMB), is a closed currency. The Chinese government controls the foreign exchange rate, as well as what foreign exchange rate of the RMB foreign banks are allowed to quote. At the moment it is pegged to the US dollar 1:1. (That exchange rate has not changed much in recent years.) Some analysts worry that the Chinese yuan (RMB) might be overvalued, that the yuan is worth more than its fundamental value. This has some worried that China is losing competitiveness. If we agree with this analysts, then it is not clear how the Chinese government will devalue the RMB. If they go suddenly, and unannounced, people who are holding yuan might be surprised to find that their holdings have suddenly become much less valuable. (I'm referring to you - holding the yuan, not the Chinese Government.) If this were 20 years ago, then a person who found themselves holding foreign currency in a country who was devaluing their currency would be in an excellent position. But these days, with the Internet as it is, there are many more people who are aware of these sorts of events, and it is more difficult to exploit one's position. If the exchange rate is allowed to float freely, without official intervention, then the foreign exchange value of the Chinese is likely to decrease over the coming decades.  To answer your specific question, if you were to invest in Chinese real estate, you might well find that you make a lot of money if there is continued growth in the Chinese economy. Unfortunately, what is not clear is if this growth is overvalued. If it is, you will find yourself trying to ""catch the falling knife."" That is, you will be selling your yuan for more USD, but since the market expects a devaluation, you will be able to find few other sellers. And when you find someone to sell to, you will find that the number of USD the sellers will exchange for the number of Yuan offered by buyers will be decreasing rapidly.  This is the situation today. It is not clear exactly how a devaluation, if it were to occur, would be implemented. This is something to keep in mind when making a decision about investing in China today."
[INST] Using credit cards online: is it safe? [/INST],"There are two primary ways to pay for something with the credit card, namely using your debit card (or using your credit card to pull money from your checking account via linked bank accounts) versus using your credit card. I am going to assume you are using a credit card and not a debit card (pulling funds from a checking account) when you make purchases online, but either way you don't need to be concerned about being skimmed or your card number being stolen. If a credit card number is stolen from the merchant you have no liability due to federal law.  There are a host of regulations that protect credit card users, such as the Fair Credit Card Billing Act (which was passed in 1986) and the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act (a.k.a. CARD Act, which was passed in 2009).  Federal laws also prevent merchants from storing your credit card data, and there are many state laws that regulate this data as well. So it isn't that merchants have made your credit card data safe, it is now illegal for merchants to store your credit card data. If you believe that merchants have your credit card data stored somewhere you should complain to your state's Attorney General.  If you are making a purchase with a debit card or by using your credit card as a debit card then things are a bit different. If your debit card number is stolen and someone uses it to make a purchase, you are not protected.  If someone goes into your checking account via your debit card then you have liability under federal law if they go in and spend money (generally up to $50); this amount is determined by the Federal Reserve regulation at 12 CFR 205.9.  But if someone spends money on your debit card number, then generally your bank's insurance has you, not the bank's, covered. However, a good fraud protection card service should prevent unauthorized purchases unless they have the actual physical card, or have your secure personal information (generally your SSN and/or mother's maiden name).  So just because someone has your credit card number does not mean they can actually spend that money without your permission.","The problem with credit/debit cards if somebody finds your card number. They only need your CC number (not even your name or CVV or 3 digits on the back of your card) to run your card on a cash machine or online. So there are 2 ways somebody would get your card number. The most common is via a hack into the company you are doing business with. The second would be via ""skimming"" where your card is stolen. Credit card fraud is a huge cost to banks as they have to reissue the credit numbers; even if they do not have to redo your bank balance.  So, how do you minimize your risk? It is very hard to do without some cost. If you shop mainly online, then try paying online using your credit card for no fee. Most credit cards and banks offer this facility. This means your credit card is not used directly, so it less likely that anybody will get the card number. Also, it means you cannot get stung multiple times because your card has been billed in parallel if your card details are stolen. The main problem with this is that some places don't like it and won't let you use this service, so you can't use all your credit cards in this way. If you still use cards direct, then make sure you keep an eye on your credit card statements for anything you don't recognize or that does not match the shop receipts. Also, don't keep too much money in your credit card bank account. If it does get compromised, you can minimize damage.  If you must shop online, then make sure the website is secure. You can find this using the website ""https://www.ssllabs.com/"" which tests if the site is secure. If the website you are using doesn't have an SSL, then assume the worst.  Lastly; use different credit cards rather than the same one for online shopping. They will still be safe if anything does go wrong.  Unfortunately most of this advice costs you more in fees than it saves you in fraud cost. The best advice is to learn how to use the web properly (eg using HTTPS only); use a VPN to secure all your web use; and avoid using cards online. Also, if you find a vendor charging you more than about 5% on a purchase, then go elsewhere. Your bank/card details are not worth that much of a saving!   For online vendors you can do more. Firstly, when you type in your card details, it probably looks like normal text. This is bad as a key logging program can get your password/key. What you want to see is scrambled text which you type into boxes. The second is make sure your card details are encrypted. The third is make sure you type in the CVV on your card, otherwise a key logger could use that to make you an online clone of your card. Sadly, all of this extra security will make your purchase a bit fiddly. Still, you reduce your risk if you cannot avoid shopping online (which you often can't).  Ultimately, if you want to really avoid fraud on your debit card, then only shop with cash. That can be a hard decision."
[INST] How do I hedge stock options like market makers do? [/INST],"From Investopedia: ""Many market makers hedge their positions by purchasing an option on one side of their transaction. For example, if they are short an out-of-the-money call, they purchase an in-the-money call option from the company or someone else that has already purchased the call they were shorting. In so doing, the position of the market maker is risk-neutral regarding the position, making the short call and the long call a synthetic position. This is in contrast to a pure short call that risks an unlimited liability as a stock moves up, which would be unacceptable to market makers."" Another link: http://www.siam.org/meetings/sdm13/130085_slides/session%203/Pricing%20Implied%20Volatility%20Using%20Gamma.pdf - slide 3","I agree with the responses saying that the stock market has become so large its impossible to hedge everything.  However its worth mentioning how some people attempt to hedge.  Also I would like to add that I do not recommend attempting to hedge without very much knowledge, nor do I know how to hedge properly. But I'll explain what it means to hedge.  To hedge stock options means to reduce risk.  There are a number of ways to do this.  A common way to hedge is to invest in uncorrelated investments.  This doesn't mean to buy investments that move completely opposite of the market but rather something that will reduce your risk if the market goes down.  An example way of doing this is to invest in real estate.  An economic downturn and a real estate downturn dont necessarily mean the same thing.  Also as the stock market goes up, its very likely interest rates will rise in order to try to cool it off, so with uncorrelated (or anti-correlated) investments you're likely to reduce your risk of loss. Another common way to hedge is simply to buy some type of put or call option.  An option will give you the opportunity to hedge or lock in a particular price with a particular broker and expire time.  This will reduce your risk.  However, it is very difficult to hedge using options on individual stocks unless you have a significant amount of investment knowledge because you'll need to know exactly when to hedge and then how to know when to close out the position. An example of a popular fund where someone can hedge, is the SPDR Gold ETF.  This tracks the movement of the price of gold so as gold goes up, you should be able to reduce your risks in a bearish stock market. Another way to hedge is to use an index fund.  These track a specific market index and will go up and down based on that index.  You can reduce your risk, but you still arent doing it by buying options.  If you have a large enough amount to invest though, you can likely offset your losses in other markets, though this is not considered hedging by most brokers."
[INST] Earning salary from USA remotely from New Zealand? [/INST],"In addition to the other answers, you also need to decide whose laws apply if anything goes wrong.   If you are an employee and are a full time employee in New Zealand, you get the protections (and pay) of New Zealand employment laws. If you are incorporated in the United States -- your employer can use U.S. employment laws. You might also want to consider if you want to be ""stuck"" with your employer -- or want the ability to leave and go work for someone else if things don't work out.   If you are actually a freelancer (rather than an employee), the situation gets more interesting.  Most contracts and other agreements are going to be ""governed by US law"", which means that you'll be bound by US law if any of the other terms are broken.   So -- decide where you really want be a citizen and the jurisdiction of the laws to apply if anything goes wrong. I'd say US citizenship and a resident alien card is the way to go -- at least if you are in a position to obtain one...","As long as you're performing your employment duties solely from the NZ - then in your capacity as an employee, nothing is needed from you apart from standard W2 / income tax forms at the end of the year. You'll have to find out any requirements pertaining to your employer such as withholding taxes if any and the like. Assuming you're in line with the Employment Laws in US ( I recommend checking with US State Dept. ) - you are free to work as a remote employee ( this is an important stipulation though, because depending on the contractual arrangements and the laws, a lot of companies actually consider this a breach of contract, so make sure this is agreed with your employer as well ) - and you should be able to do it.  You might want to check with the USCIS (US Visa processing) to see if you need to acquire any visa if you wish to travel extensively - or just stick with the Skype and phone.

[INST] What significant negative factors affect Yahoo's valuation? [/INST],"In your words you suggest that Yahoo is 'just a search engine'. If that is your only impression of their business, it is unlikely you can accurately measure their potential. They are a huge company with thousands of employees and dozens of product lines including several very profitable ones. Yahoo Mail is an extremely profitable business, and as you suggest, the traffic they receive is enormous (and profitable in various ways, not just banner ads). Yahoo Finance is also very profitable. You could spend millions of dollars and years developing a web mail product comparable to Yahoo Mail but it would not be nearly as profitable for you, simply because the traffic would not be as large. You cannot compare Yahoo Mail to AOL Mail and say: ""there must be something up with Yahoo; you must have screwed something up"", because AOL Mail is much less profitable than Yahoo Mail, and it is because AOL Mail receives far less traffic. Why? Well, AOL is significantly smaller in terms of subscribers, and although AOL has very loyal users, their mail product is nowhere near as popular as Yahoo Mail, Gmail, or Microsoft's MSN e-mail service. And the more traffic your product gets, the more you can charge for advertising (because you have the users to back it up)!","The obvious negative factor is its declining revenue. I am not sure it is significant enough but it is there. Also, a lot of its stock is owned by institutional investors who may sell their ownership due to company management's refusal to increase the dividends of its common stock. Also, some of that institutional and/or individual stock may turn away from the company as they prefer to put their money in new tech instead of old tech. This would be a significant negative factor in my opinion, if true, but it is not as significant as declining revenue."
"[INST] After Market Price change, how can I get it at that price? [/INST]","I don't understand your question.  You are asking if you can get the lower price you saw after the market close?  The answer is no.  That is called the ""after-market,"" it is not the actual stock market.  After you see that the price is lower (for example $3.00 the next morning when you wake up), the price may continue to drop.  It all depends on people who want to purchase shares of that stock for the following trading day, when the market re-opens.  The shareholders of the company also may still wish to sell shares and will probably have a limit on how low they are willing to accept for their shares, so that may limit how low the price will go.","How does one get shares of a stock without actually buying them? First, you'll need to contact your broker. Ask them to sell your shares at market price. They'll ask you how many you want to sell.  If they say no, you got your answer. If you have an amount you want to sell, you can then call the shareholder meeting and have as many votes counted as shares you sell. This is not generally required for all members of the board, however many companies are now giving this to those who vote for it."
"[INST] Starting an investment portfolio with Rs 5,000/- [/INST]",My suggestions are not to buy a policy from any other company. 1. Open a PPF account. The minimum investment for PPF is Rs 500/- and can be topped up any time in the year.  At maturity it can be reinvested again with interest added every year.  2. Open a SIP (systematic investment plan) in mutual fund with an amount as low as Rs. 500/- in a liquid scheme.  Liquid schemes are those which are listed on stock exchange and hence can be redeemed or reinvested at short notice.  3. Start a small pension / RV scheme.,"While you could just sit it in a savings account and hope that inflation works in your favor, if you are saving this money towards buying a house or property then you should start looking at investment opportunities that minimize risk while still trying to maximize growth. I highly recommend investing in index mutual funds, whereby your money is invested in an assorted basket of large cap stocks, and not put in an individual stock. An example portfolio could be something similar to this: The mix of stocks and bonds is to help minimize the risks. If you are a young investor you should be willing to take on more risk by putting the majority of your money into stock funds such as equity funds, index funds and exchange traded funds. If you are planning on using your savings for a house downpayment you may want to delay investing or look into GICs that come with a 100% maturity guarantee. I can also refer you to this website for further information on how to invest in TFSAs and RRSPs."

[INST] Is it legal to receive/send “gifts” of Non-Trivial Amounts to a “friend”? [/INST],"If your friend were to send you money for nothing in return, and then ask for money back, he wasn't giving you a gift, he was making a loan.  If it was not a gift, but a loan, then it is subject to the same laws as a loan, including usury restrictions.  If it was a gift, then the law does not normally concern you or your friend. The law does get involved if the gift is from an anonymous source, such as your friend winning a free car from a contest, but it may not be a legal gift.  In such a circumstance, your friend is the recipient of a gift that has a catch. If they win a free car, but they have to advertise for the seller in order for the gift to remain valid, then that is a catch. Your friend is probably more interested in your financial stability than you might think.  Some people would go so far as to say that the true purpose of gifts is to give recipients reasons to be obligated to their donors.",So you're saying you want to use this as a tax shelter to write off these expenses as a gift to your spouse?

[INST] Value of credit score if you never plan to borrow again? [/INST],"For your bank to accept your request for your own deeded funds as payment, it will look to you as a client with creditworthiness. If you don't have a credit score, they won't be able to evaluate you. The most important thing to realize is that the bank will not be going through the expense of the loan request; therefore, their risk has already been mitigated, as you are repaying your own loan.  If anything, it could potentially be a burden to any future lending request if this current loan is not paid as a ""traditional"" loan. You state this is a loan of $150k.  I would expect that would be for a while! A bank will be more than willing to accept $150k as a loan repayment, even though you are simply transferring funds back from your own account. I do not believe credit will have anything to do with it, only a bank-generated loan application that your banker will fill out with payment info. If anything, you could be giving your banker a future lead (and $150k) by establishing a line of funding (the money you would be paying back) to the bank that you can withdraw as a loan for other purposes, should you choose to do so in the future.","As a US citizen, you cannot just ignore your credit. You can, however, decide that you would like to have no credit. The way to achieve that is to have no open, active credit cards. You can close them in the US (contact the card issuer to verify your balance was paid in full, and the account was in good standing). Your score will drop, but will have some small residual value (probably a C). In order to show your responsibility, you can make small purchases, and pay them off. If you do this repeatedly, your score will increase (although it would probably be around 650, so I'd be careful with interest rates). There are some people that advocate ""credit repairs"". These ""consultants"" will try to ""fix"" your history and remove negative items from your record. Do not do this. Such actions can cost thousands of dollars, but are not allowed. I had a friend (now ex-of course) who was working for a company that did this. We are long gone from that area, but the company had just moved in. The state attorney's office was raiding the company. Not only were they not actually doing what they claimed, they were committing perjury by faking the affidavits. It's amazing what some people try to do for money. Do not do any such things. Your best bet is to simply close some cards, and just have one (if you actually do need a credit card). It's important to note that even if your history is completely clean, you will not be immune to identity theft. You can request a police report, but it will only indicate that you were a victim, not that anyone was brought to justice. It's your choice. You are a law abiding citizen, and I'm sure you'll make whatever choice you feel most comfortable with."
"[INST] What happens if one brings more than 10,000 USD with them into the US? [/INST]","The 10k limit applies to cash and equivalents.  They've never clearly specified what constitutes cash equivalents, but in practice they've never caught cash in an amount under that and tried to tax it.  The US is trying to catch currency smuggling, not keep people from bringing in dollars for their foreign vacations.  So ""nearly any cash"" would probably suffice for the limit to be over unless you're talking about several hundred thousand dollars or the equivalent foreign currency in an amount that large.  This is pretty much a ""don't look if it's under 10k"" rule, though it's applied to all declarations over 10k of all cash equivalents.","You're confusing two types of money counting. While there are exceptions, one can legally bring more than $10,000 into the US, but only in the form of cash and currency. There is no limit in any form of currency that is not cash/coins. $1,000,000 USD from the bank, money market, bonds, checks, etc. are all considered foreign banknote equivalents and are reportable."
[INST] Why buy a vertical spread if I could instead buy a naked call? [/INST],"First of all, your question title confuses me a bit, because it seems like I've left out something critical - in your original description of the scenario, you explicitly state that you are holding the stock. If you're long, the market makers are selling calls to you and buying puts from you, thus creating vertical spread. It is certainly possible to do a vertical spread by selling puts and buying calls, but only if you don't have the shares, or intend to short the shares you already own. It's important to realize that a bullish call purchase is not the same as a bullish vertical spread. The difference is in the delta. If you buy a stock and then buy a call, the delta of your net position will not be zero - it will be the delta of the call, which in your example would be around 23% (see here), so you still expose yourself to the risk of loss of stock price, the delta of which could be less than 0 if the stock plummets. If you buy puts and buy calls, the delta of your position will tend towards zero, as a delta of -50% will approximately cancel the delta of a call. That is the only mathematical ""benefit"" of vertical spread, so the more general question is of course whether it makes sense to take the higher probability of success offered by the vertical spread, in exchange for giving up the greater upside afforded by a stock purchase/call purchase. On a technical level, the seller of the option is collecting some amount of ""time premium"" that should be considered against your implied ""time premium"" when calculating net profit/loss. You should have been compensated for the time you gave up when you sold the puts.","The short answer is that you could, but you shouldn't, at least not without first changing risk profile.   The vertical spread is much lower risk than an at-the-money long call: If the stock goes up, you lose a substantial amount of money relative to your premium.  If it goes down, you only lose a bit.  If it stays flat, you actually make money.   If you can't stand the risk, do the vert, and you'll be OK at a loss as long as the stock price stays within a certain range.  But you have to be prepared to have your account down that 2.72x$2.50, or the cost of the spread  I don't know whether you can write a long call to sell a short call, but I don't think so.  You need something in the middle to match up with the strike.  I also don't really understand why you would want to, with this volatility premium."
"[INST] Why would I want a diversified portfolio, versus throwing my investments into an index fund? [/INST]","You would want a diversified portfolio because the future is uncertain.  No one knows what investments will be successful, and even more importantly, no one knows which asset class (stocks, bonds, gold, real estate, etc) will be successful in the future.  If you have all your investments in a single market segment, when that market segment underperforms the other market segments then you are stuck with a portfolio full of losing investments.  A diversified portfolio that balances the market segments based on the historical data allows you to lower the total risk (standard deviation) of your overall portfolio without sacrificing your annual growth rate.  (A well-diversified portfolio will have about 30% less overall risk (standard deviation in the rate of return over time) than an equally weighted index fund of the same market segment).  The key to diversification is to diversify your market segments at the lowest cost possible.","1. The markets have gone higher over the last 25 years, however that does not necessarily mean they will continue upward at that pace.  An index fund can still go down in a large correction, and when it does your portfolio will go down.  If you are heavily invested in an index fund, you have no diversification, your savings are invested with the market.  2. There are many different types of returns out there, if you invest in stocks in 1929 and then sold them in 1933, you would think the markets were a poor choice for investment.  You would be wrong, from 1923-2007 your average return was close to 10%, meaning if you bought in 1923, your savings would have quintupled over the next 84 years without the need for any intervention on your part.  Of course if you look at 2007, that number drops, it is about 8%.  However that is still a good number.  That does not mean you should buy and sell when you think you might make some money.  That means that you should follow a sound plan, have a financial plan and revisit its success based on the goals you and your adviser set.   There are many different markets out there, and all of them can serve a purpose in your portfolio.  In some case you invest in index mutual funds with a low cost, some you invest in actively managed mutual funds with a goal of outpacing the index.   Some of the more advanced investors I advise have a strategy that involves an additional retirement accounts that are tax sheltered, have them invested in more risky investments, the invest that funds in that account monthly, quarterly or yearly depending on the financial plan that is created.  If you are younger, then you might want to invest more money into the higher risk accounts, and if you are older might want to put that money in a lower risk investment.  There are a lot of factors to consider, and the best way to evaluate your need for a change (from what you have now and if any change is the best for you) is to find a Certified Financial Planner and discuss your situation.  At least you can be sure that any person advising you will have taken classes on the topic and met the exam standards, and have done so."
[INST] Is it better to buy put options or buy an inverse leveraged ETF? [/INST],"The ETF should not be used as a substitute for options. Both instruments have their advantages and disadvantages, but are very different beasts.  ETFs are, essentially, mutual funds that provide the holder with shares that trade like a stock. The advantage to an ETF is that as the price of the underlying investment tracks up or down, the price of the ETF will match. So if you sell the ETF when the underlying moves up, you'll incur a capital gain (subject to federal income tax) that matches the gain on the fund. For options trading, however, you must pay taxes on gains regardless of the type of tax. So if a call you purchase for a stock increases in value (assuming you use 409A valuations to calculate your gain), you have to pay taxes regardless of whether you decide to exercise the call early (at strike price) or sell it back into the market (for its current market value). In the case of the call, you'll wind up having two transactions that result in taxes for you - both a capital gain and a disposition gain. Furthermore, the exchange-traded funds do not allow early conversion. That is, the fund's manager will not allow you to re-invest your capital back into other securities of the fund or into new investment vehicles as they come onto the market. Finally, when buying ETFs, there are usually two kinds of share classes -- one for investors and one for market makers. If you're just trying to play short-term price swings, there's a strong possibility that your mutual fund's share class for investors will have a higher tracking error which may make such a bet more difficult than you expect. It's likely that the more heavily indexed trading will favor one type of share class while your personal position will be based upon the other, so that any gains (on the market as a whole, as you're playing) won't benefit your share in proportion to the fund because it's tracking the market based on the indexing that applies to the other type of share you hold. So, for example, if trading increases across the entire market, your mutual fund will reflect that move exactly, but your own personal position may be hurt by the market's trading because that's happening on the class of shares that has less liquidity. For a call, you are essentially trading the current value of the underlying (i.e. the current price of the underlying) against the strike price (which isn't changing unless your seller was unwise and tried to make an early assignment). So, for the next example, we'll assume that the initial price of your underlying is 10.00 and the strike price is 12.00. Then, when you exercise your call, you effectively pay the current price of 10 and receive a new underlying worth 12, which is in your favor (i.e. a gain). You then can either sell it or continue holding your new stock. You pay tax on any increase in value above the 10.00 you handed over to receive your new stock. So the net effect to you would be that your initial capital is unchanged, but your capital gain is now 100% and since options are taxed at 60% (unless you used a qualifying strike, which seems unlikely from your description), your tax on the gain would be 60%. Thus you have an advantage over an ETF since you'll be paying lower taxes now on your gain rather than waiting for a sale 30 days in the future, if you sell. However, the ETF will still probably make you more money than the option that you bought if you hold it for 30 days in this example because its price will tend to increase more in your favor than your call. If you're willing and able to accept that risk of holding your ETF for a month in case its price moves the wrong way, you may do better there. But, in a nutshell, ETFs are the best tool for tracking returns of the underlying investment, but options are better when you are looking to capture a return for being short the underlying investment and want to profit no matter what direction the underlying market moves, and don't mind taking the trade off in return for the convenience of receiving a capital gain now rather than waiting for the ETF to catch up to the underlying. Note, if you're looking to make a prediction about the market's direction, there are other trading instruments available that will give you more precise choices than either of these.","Why not just buy the stock directly? By using puts you are taking a larger risk than the inverse ETF is in terms of price fluctuation, for any given % gain or loss on the ETF, a short term put might go down only half as much, but a long term put may lose about the same and in this case the put may even lose less on a up day as the stock could go up but still be below the strike price."
"[INST] Get car loan w/ part time job as student with no credit, no-cosigner but no expenses [/INST]","I have a question for you.  Why do you need a loan?  Do you already have a car that needs a loan to help you put money onto it?  It looks like your credit is ok, though it could also be that your parents are your co-signers.  You could get a normal auto loan and pay them directly on that.  Of course, it may also be that you need a loan because you are starting the search for a car now.  In that case, I would recommend that you do exactly what you're doing - look carefully at the finance options that dealers give you.  Most dealers will try to have you finance through them in order to get higher sales margins on the profits gained from that financing.  Of course, there's nothing wrong with getting a regular auto-loan.  That's what I normally do.  All of my purchases so far have been financed in this way!  It's good that you're a budgeter - it helps to set goals in this way.  The monthly amount you want to pay for your car is very important.  It's also good that you want to pay as much cash down as possible.  I usually pay around 60-80% down on my cars and then spread the remaining amount over 2.5 years.  This gives me enough time to save up for any additional money I want to put towards the purchase, while still paying more on the principle, rather than the interest.   I'd also like to take this opportunity to say that you are very financially aware for your age.  Most new grads, even those that have been working for a few years, are completely unaware of their finances.  It is definitely an area you can gain an advantage at and I'd highly recommend that you take a look at Dave Ramsey.com for additional assistance.  He has many additional resources that may help you in your financial endeavours!","When you talk about car loans, you're also talking about cars--specific models, year and age of the vehicle you're considering purchasing. So, my first bit of advice is to figure out what car you want. Then, go to a dealership that sells the brand of vehicle you're interested in, and ask that dealership if they have financing they can arrange that would fit your situation. Some dealerships do, and it might be much easier for you if you go directly to them for financing. If going directly to the dealership isn't a viable option, you can also go to several different credit unions and ask them to give you a secured car loan. With this type of loan, you put down a large downpayment (say $5,000 or more), and the loan covers the rest. Once you begin making payments on the loan, that becomes your credit history. There are other options as well, but the above suggestions are the most likely to work for you based on your situation."
[INST] Optimize return of dividends based on payout per share [/INST],"If you invest in the company at $6/share, you will get 0.14$/share in dividends. In other words, the dividend is 2% of the share price at the time you invest. However, if you sell the stock, it is possible that the price has increased over time, so now you only get 0.11$/share. If the company sells for the same price that you paid, you have a 15% gain. However, your holding period may influence your decision. If you want to hold on to the stock, and perhaps reinvest dividends and grow your stake in the company, you will sell less often and increase your wealth. If you invest in the company for just a few days/weeks and only hold for the dividends, you will probably sell more frequently, and thus have to spend more fees to get your money in and out. Note that many shares trade on markets that charge fees for investors who invest daily or weekly. If you invest in the company every two days instead of every week, the total fees over your time holding the shares will decrease for a large company.","As @JoeTaxpayer's comment said, you are comparing apples and oranges. One company's return might be in dividends and cashback, while the other's might be in shareholder appreciation or buying back shares. You can't really compare those.  That doesn't mean you ignore these numbers.  You can only judge the amount these two companies have paid out in all three ways:  What you have to look at is what percentage of their company value they have put back in.  That is a good metric, but be aware that the dividend yield is not a good valuation tool. A better way to see how much money companies were paying out as dividends would be to see the Dividend to Book value ratio.  That way you can see how they are using retained earnings.  I'll show you some data you can make a comparison from.  Using the top 10 companies in each, here's a few numbers using Morningstar data. P&G returned more capital as dividends in the last 6 years as Coca-Cola, but Coca-Cola has paid back more than P&G as a total dividend over the last ten (25.43%/24.43%). Coca-Cola and P&G have taken in more money in cashback programs, but Coca-Cola has paid out a higher % as that revenue (13%/5.48%, though Coca-Cola has only offered the cashback since 2012 and P&G since 2006). So yes, P&G has beaten out Coca-Cola.  Coke has paid more of its profits in dividends, but 41.3% of its profits went back to shareholders in the last 6 years in the form of the dividends.  P&G paid out more in cashback programs than Coca-Cola. Neither have paid a dividend since FY 2014. Coca-Cola's last dividend yield was under 3%, I believe. You need to dig in and look at trends on these companies based on the data you have to actually judge a stock and see if it has been a good investment.  If anything, I'd tell you to watch out on Coca Cola until they pay another dividend.  That's not a good sign. Even with the high cashback and low dividend."
[INST] Why do consultants or contractors make more money than employees? [/INST],"There are 2 issues at play there: There are some jobs (or specializations such as software engineers) where the candidate has more choice in where they get jobs. If the employer has to compete and give something away for each new hire, they have to offer more. This is a classic market economy issue of supply and demand. If there is ""high demand, low supply,"" the price will rise, in this case, the job offer will improve. In many business fields there is relatively low ""demand"" and high ""supply"". The talent pool is wide open, the employer has many choices for new hires, and the ""going price"" in such markets is lower.  In the second case there is a ""value"" to hiring them. That is: if you buy a product, the product is worth the price you paid for it. If you hire a consultant (let's say), there is a perceived value that the consultant's expertise adds to your company's operation.  This adds value to your overall business operation. There is a perceived level, and by that I mean the company's estimation, where they find it worth ""paying the cost"" of that level of expertise. Some companies believe a high level of expertise can add a great deal of value and are therefore more willing to pay for those services. Other companies think they can get the job done adequately with a lower tier of service and as such will pay less.  Note that, in both cases, there is a ""going rate"" for these things. There are websites that have hourly rates for what people in the industry are being paid, and a company knows what the ""going rate"" is. To avoid going too far afield, those rates are generally much lower for a non-exempt employee (""reg: exempt"" people get a 2 week bonus in the US called salary) and, to some degree or another, this also is affected by the size of the company. So basically, there is a ""going rate"" for many services, and the demand/supply of that talent determines what a company is willing to pay a company for the service. That's why the companies might be willing to pay more or less for the service: it all depends on the business needs and market conditions for that skill.","If the employer is forced to accept a higher price for the service, the work may become less profitable and the employee may be laid off, or the company may go bankrupt."
[INST] Company revenue increased however stock price did not [/INST],"The short-term impact of an increase in revenue can vary depending on what information investors are looking for. A high revenue increase could have positive sentiment from investors. As for what investors are looking for I would think investors would be looking for an increase in net profit margin, or increase in revenue growth percent over previous quarter. So for an increase in profit margin you would want to see an increase in gross margin. For an increase in revenue growth you would be looking at a year over year increase. With the stock price not seeing an increase short term if revenue increases you can look at the long term view. If you look at the year over year percent growth for revenue you'd look at the prior several quarters. So if the increase is from a lower comparative number a year ago and looking to meet the expectations set a year ago with a flat percent change this wouldn't create a positive short-term impact. And yes, you would probably see a decrease in earnings for EPS depending on the change in margin and gross revenues.","If the company is currently valued (shares outstanding multiplied by the price of the shares) at $10B and it just released earnings of $1.50/share, that implies a price/earnings multiple of 6.667.   That's not a bad number - though maybe on the high side relative to what the industry as a whole is paying - but this alone wouldn't explain the stock selling off on 10%-15% volume relative to a daily average.  Perhaps there is a fundamental problem with the underlying business, leading investors to fear that profits will stall or drop in the short to medium term.  Maybe there is a problem with the company's cash flows that might lead to bankruptcy or other difficulties down the road.  Another possible explanation is a one time ""event"" that has distorted recent earnings, say maybe the company just entered a new accounting period - it has some expenses that it frontloaded at the end of the prior fiscal year and it took a charge that will not repeat in the current period.  Whatever the reason, such a drop on an earnings-beating day is not good.  It would be much better for the company to actually miss earnings and beat them on the next report - as most stocks tend to trade up in the morning and then gradually slide down to around the closing price over the day of the earnings release."
[INST] Protecting Gains: Buying a Put vs. Leveraged Bear Market vs. Liquidating Long Positions? [/INST],"Assuming you want to hold your long position, then a put option is a good way to protect against extreme market drops. The longer the life of the call option the less it will cost. As you are in a highly leveraged position, then a put to protect 100% of your gains makes sense.  But, buying $75k worth of a put option is going to be expensive (like $30k and up). If you cannot afford this much of a loss in the value of the stock, then you may want to explore other risk mitigation strategies such as diversifying with other investments (different types of stocks, gold, currency, bonds, etc) or liquidating some of your current long positions (if applicable).  If you are talking about your retirement portfolio where a significant amount of your wealth is tied up in equities, then the most risk-averse strategy is to invest in mutual funds.  Mutual funds have a high diversity of investment styles that give you the ability to ride out significant downturns.  They give you the ability to sell your investment positions for cash in order to raise money for cash if you can't find other sources of money (which would reduce your losses on your investment positions). There are some very good Mutual Funds out there with low expense ratios and low annual fees.","This isn't a complete answer, but part of it goes like this... Put options have their own risk, because they could expire out of the money, they are an ""off balance sheet"" risk that have to be managed within the portfolio. If I purchase a long (call) option, I have a defined amount of risk, but my downside is not limited. If I purchase a long (call) option and I make money through the time decay effect, but the share price drops in the process, I can still lose money. This is because that time decay gain was lost as the stock price dropped, but I can still lose more due to the expiration of the option. The same is true with a put option. If I purchased a long put option in Bank of America, which for some reason dropped from its current level of $17/share to $5/share, the time decay portion of my put option could be up $10, but I might only have 6 months left before it expires, so I could theoretically still be down, even though I am still under the $17 strike price."
"[INST] What does it mean “sell on ask” , “sell on bid” in stocks? [/INST]","For the person interested in buying, they may have indicated that they will meet the market price, or if there is not a market price, they will meet the current price of the last executed trade. What this means is that there is nobody else trying to make a deal at the moment. The only offer on the table is the current market price, and that's all that counts, either the person you are selling to, or the person you are buying from is willing to meet the market price (which could be changing all the time). This does not mean that the deal will necessarily be done - maybe there is a huge gap between the ask price and bid price. (The difference between the ask price and the bid price is what makes them attractive to somebody interested in buying).","To clarify, the ask price is what a seller is asking for, while the bid price is what a buyer is willing to pay. (This is basically the market, or price, of an asset.) A broker who executes a customer's order can either fill (buy) the order from a buyer at the offered asking price, or can try to sell it at a higher price (to a different buyer, in the market). It seems that brokers have the option of whether they want to fill the order, or try to sell it for a higher price (to a different buyer), but do sellers have a choice on whether they want to accept less for their shares than the ask price (i.e., do they want that customer to buy their shares, or are they willing to sell at a higher price)?"
"[INST] A stock just dropped 8% in minutes and now all of a sudden the only way to buy is on the ask, what does this mean? [/INST]","You're probably looking at a level II order book, right? Here's an example from Yahoo Finance for Coca-Cola (KO), showing 89 open bids and nearly 23,000 open asks;  a quick glance also indicates the market is very thin for orders over around $52 or so.  Aside from that, I don't see anything irregular.  The only thing irregular would be if some kind of news or announcement had come out causing the big movements. There isn't a single price level for a stock (i.e. you're asking for all or none of the shares available); the quote you're looking at shows the level of the last trade on the left hand side ($57.15), and then to the right, you can see the highest offer (bid), and the lowest ask, separated by various spreads.  See this Wikipedia article for more information.","I found a great article about what happened and why here:   There are two things that need special attention: 1. Regulation Fair Disclosure   and  2) a little thing called the ""circuit breaker"".   Let's take a look at each: 1.  Regulation Fair disclosure, commonly know as Reg FD,   was adopted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on October 30, 2000. It was adopted as a way to level the playing field between ""big money"" investors, the ones that can pay big bucks to   listen to conference calls and read press releases, and small or individual   investors, which is pretty much anyone that lacks the ability to invest   millions of dollars at a time. Reg FD states that public companies must disclose significant or material information in a    manner that allows all investors to easily access the information: either through   press releases, SEC filings, or their web site, or in some way through a 3rd party   service like Bloomberg, or Reuters.  If a company fails to follow SEC guidelines, any party not previously ""notified""   of the information has the ability to file ""lawsuits under Section 10(b) and Section   14(a)(3) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 and Rule 14a-9 under the Securities Exchange Act   of 1934."" 2.  The SEC has the ability to implement an ""Excess Circuit Breaker"" as part of the   regulations that govern the trading of equities, and to prevent further   selling of the stock. Once a stock trades at a certain level, in this case a drop   of 10% in less than three minutes, the ""Excess Circuit Breaker"" is triggered.   That would prevent anyone (individual or institutional investor) from selling the   stock for a period of 15-minutes. Once the prohibition expires, the stock can be   traded at its current price. However, under normal market conditions where no   one is selling, and prices are rising, ""the price limit was reinstated allowing   trading at 0.05 points above the national best bid."" So, if your stock gets whipsawed, and drops 10 or more points within three   minutes, the SEC could very quickly step in to prevent further selling.  The   investor that was selling the most, and has the ability to drop a stock more than   one of three minutes in most circumstances, is the mutual fund. ""Selling"" here means ""selling to make someone else a buyer"", not necessarily   a ""market sell"". In reality, you as an individual investor or a private investor have little control over the ability   of others to buy or sell, unless you hold a ""control share"".  It is a very common practice among large institutional investors to use computer trading systems where orders are placed, trades are submitted, and transactions occur on their behalf. The orders are usually placed far above (or below for sell orders),   the best bid or ""excess bid"" price, and allow for a quicker transition between   the current price and the new price. This results in very quick buying and selling  transactions that would allow for some large order to move a stock 10 points higher or lower in just a few minutes.  What you are describing here is someone trying to get to the ""good stuff"" early, and buying something that a large investor was planning to dump (sell).   It could have been planned as a ""pump and dump"", or perhaps there is another reason to make a large investment in a stock - like a merger, acquisition, or maybe the 4th quarter results are higher than they were for the past three quarters?  This does not necessarily make the selling investor a ""villain"", it merely shows a certain amount of sophistication and knowledge to be able to recognize an opportunity, and take advantage of it."
[INST] I may earn a lot of cash soon through self-employment on a lucrative project.  How to handle the tax? [/INST],"If you are employed part time in a separate job but make a lot of money on the side, chances are taxes will already be taken off. If you don't want to do your taxes manually, you can hire a professional to do them once a year.  The benefits include making less mistakes and deducting possible business expenditures like paying for a business web site.  If you need advice or tips on picking a CPA, check out The CPA Selection Guide. If you are going to work for yourself full time you may be considered a business or have the tax liability of one.  As such, you can hire a tax CPA year-round to help with any issues that may arise (eg business expenditures, pay yourself what you think you are worth, making estimates for future expenditures like a new computer, etc). If your business expenses will not be over 75K, you can even file your taxes yourself for a one time $100 fee.  A CPA will know if this qualifies.  Also, you may have to pay quarterly estimate payments (especially if you will be making over $100K).  If you do, hiring a tax CPA in this case is not a bad idea.  You may also want to ask them about making estimated payments and when to make them.  The website for the business and self-employment taxes is www.irs.gov","You're asking a lot of questions that are better directed to a tax professional - for instance, what do ""costs"" even mean on this project, and what is their basis and will you realize them during this current project, or in the future with other projects? But to answer your title question: You will still be liable for your own taxes in the future."
[INST] Is there any drawback in putting all my 401K into a money market fund? [/INST],"One of the big reasons you want to try to diversify across the whole stock market is because you're trying to minimize the risk of losing value if, for example, the whole NASDAQ goes down. But if you're using a Roth 401k, you should be contributing as much as possible and putting that contribution into whichever of the stock or bond choices (i.e: mutual funds) has the lowest management fees. In that case, while you could say it's not very risky -- since a lot of your stocks won't go down -- the low management fees help minimize that loss of value.","Your employer doesn't offer any matching on your 401k money. That is one drawback. If they match any money you contribute they should be matched by the same percentage you contribute. If you want to be a millionaire before you die, you should be stashing away at least 10% of your salary every year until you earn enough that it is hard to save 10%. For example, if your pay is $10,000 each month try stashing at least $1000 per month into your 401k. You may want to save more than that. Your employer will match your 401K contribution up to 7% depending on how long you've worked for them. I personally would rather use dollar cost averaging, which is more than contributing the minimum to get the company match, but less than the max 16K which you can put away in a 401k.  If you are investing in a money market fund instead of a mutual fund then you need to find the right money market fund.  Look for a fund that invests 75% or more of its holdings are in quality money market and cash equivalents and/or in short-term US Treasury debt. Do not let yourself be enticed by the fancy money market funds which might invest in more risky things. There are money market funds that are invested in junk bonds which make monthly interest payments. If you chose the wrong money market fund and there is a panic and no liquidity (ability to redeem your shares for cash) things might not work out so well."
[INST] What is a 401(k) Loan Provision? [/INST],"Generally a 401k loan provision allows you to borrow money in your account for a certain amount of time, generally 5 years or the loan is due.  See page 22 in this IRS publication.   Another 401k loan provision can apply in limited circumstances, like if you're in the process of buying a home.  See page 32 in this IRS publication","With any 401(k) plan, there are certain provisions that govern the use of any balance that exceeds your loan balance.  Since your balance at the end of the year is only $3, so there is nothing to worry about.  But, it is important to know that there is a vesting schedule for employer matching deposited into your account.  If your employer has a vesting schedule, your employer will not release funds to you if you leave their employment before being fully vested.  (My employer matches any deposit that you make up to 8% with a 1:1 match.  If I contribute 8% of my salary, my employer will deposit 8% of my salary into my account.  If I leave after my first year of employment (one year vesting period), I forfeit 25% of my employer matching deposit; after 3 years, 75% is vested; and after five years, all my employer matching deposits are vested and freely available to me.)  There are a number of other employer specific provisions that govern 401(k) account balances, and the 60-day rollover provision is only one of them.  To find out more about any one specific 401(k) plan, you need to read the summary plan description.  But, I find that most 401(k) plans are administered pretty much the same way.  It is only the contribution limitations and employer matching that vary by employer."
[INST] What is the meaning of realization in finance? [/INST],"It is referring to the market value of the company based on current pricing.  So for example, if we had a business that cost $100m to build and start-up, but in today's market is selling for $500m.  The $500m is said to be the market-capitalization or market-value of the company.  We say it is 'realized' if the money is actually in the bank. For instance, if we sold $200m of that company already, that would only be a realized capitalization of $200m and would mean that $200m is in our bank account already (realized).  If we sold the company tomorrow for $500m, that would mean an increase in our realized revenue of $300m.","Imagine you work in a company.  You have two workers, Smith and Jones.  You would like to figure out how productive Smith is.  One way is to measure his productivity.  But, in effect, measurement is like estimation on your part, and you hope to get a close estimate that is accurate. In reality you will not be accurate, and your estimation error in Smith's productivity will be a measure of how accurate your judgement is, or your ""realization."" (or knowledge) One method to determine how accurate you are is to calculate the average error in your estimates (the average absolute deviation of the difference between the estimate and what was actually realized) by calculating all possible combinations of workers, and subtracting each of those errors from each other.  In general, this process of getting all the possible combinations is akin to looking at all possible futures or scenarios where Smith's productivity is known.  This might consist of asking other workers like smith about his productivity.  In the end, the process of determining how accurate your estimates are is a measure of your knowledge. If you only guessed Smith's productivity in one way, his average productivity might be different, although you will still have this error, because each estimate for Smith's productivity could be estimated using another combination of estimates (different estimations could be used), and they might be more accurate.   You might find that Smith's productivity is very hard to get an accurate estimation of, so your average error in your estimates might be high.  In this case, you won't have a very good estimate of smith's productivity. In financial markets, the information and data about markets and the entities in a market, is the sum of everyone's judgement about them (or lack thereof).  Since markets and what is therein is constantly changing, our average errors in our estimates will change every time we update them (at the time in which we update them).   As financial markets rely on peoples' judgement, the average accuracy of everyone's judgement will tell you how knowledgeable people are in terms of estimating their judgement, and the more accurate people's judgement are, the more accurate our financial markets will be. Note that while people's judgement will change with time, the sum of everyone's judgement will always remain constant.  In this sense, you can see that there is no possible market in which average judgement is zero because as soon as average judgement is zero, people would update their judgement to increase the average judgement to be greater than zero."
[INST] Is this legal: going long on call options and artificially increasing the price of the underlying asset seconds before expiration? [/INST],"There isn't any actual buying/selling of the underlying taking place.  All you're doing is making a contract to buy at a higher strike at expiration.   The strike price of the call could be below the market price at expiration, say $99, and still finish the trade ""in-the-money."" All that's required is that the market price goes up during the day, then stays the same until expiration.","What you are describing is basically a ""Pump and Dump,"" except it is all legal.  Most of the scammers are on the other side of this trade, and most of the legitimate scammers have been exposed. The scammers are the guys that you see the stories about on the news.  But here's the secret:  There are a few honest ones, who would be just as happy to keep the stock's share price high than see it slide.   Let me explain a little bit more:  Take Google for example.  Google had an IPO at $85 a share.  Since then, it has been climbing.  Let's say it reached $500 in a few months, then one guy came out and said, ""Hey, Google really isn't going to make that much money, it's just a good idea, it's not really going to make money.""  And let's pretend that he is correct, and he is somehow able to convince lots of people to sell.  That just means that this guy now has a lot of stock to dump on the market, and he sells it at a profit.  But, just because this guy is correct, doesn't make it right for him to scam the retail investor into paying $500 for a single share of Google.  The honest pump and dumpers try to ""pump"" a company up, and at some point, either there is some technical flaw to the company, or it's just not making the kind of money that the company has projected.  So they slowly release news that they are getting slower for them, and then they release news that makes this slowdown sound positive.  Then, they keep releasing more details, and if people are stupid, they buy the stock, because they think that it is going to go up.  If they think that they can get you to buy stock, and make a profit off of someone else who is also buying the stock, then it is no concern to them.  I guess this should be your first clue that this trade might be too good to be true: If you can do it on the last day for pennies a share, why did you keep the other shares?  If you are holding Google, why would you want the value of the company to drop?  Because it really, really shouldn't be dropping.  If anything, it should be increasing on the news of higher demand, and increased efficiency.  And if someone was smart enough to find this trick, then why did they do it the day after?  And why did they do it the day after the day after?  This guy seems like a moron. This guy is really trying to scam you, and he is not the first to try.  It really is a pump and dump scheme.  If you would allow me to go in to details, then maybe the SEC should know about this guy, along with your account manager. If this is an honest story, but somehow still illegal, then I think that your question needs to be modified, because from what I've heard, they are not illegal, but the people have just done it wrong.  And for that, the SEC is investigating, but the SEC hasn't yet ruled as if these kinds of pumping schemes are inappropriate and unlawful, so I see no reason to make a stink, yet.  Also, you say in the comments that you are in Brazil, right?  If you want a second opinion, you can go to your local FSB and ask the officers there, or maybe the police station to do some further investigation outside of the SEC."
[INST] Vanguard ETF vs mutual fund [/INST],"The ETF is meant to mirror a fund.  There are many questions of why it would or should deviate from a fund.

The coupons for the bond are 5% x $19,790, so these must be paid every 6 months. The coupons are $760, so the first would be paid 6 months from now, the next would be 1 year, 6 months. Therefore 6 months from now A = 101 - (760 * 0.04) A = 102.48 So then the 6 month later A would be A = 102.48 - (760 * 0.03) which is 102.13 At the 12 month mark the 6 month old A would be A + (760 * 0.02) which is 102.61, the cash flow would pay off the amount owed of $17,692.19 (S), then the remaining cash flow of 198.81 would pay $55.88, so A at that point would be 103.1667. So the original bonds A value will be 103.1667 and 16.8333 would be the new share.","It's unlikely that you'd be making $133,100 each and every month, so your net cash flow will end up closer to $2,200/month.  So, after the year is up, you will have earned back the principal value of the bond.  Beyond that, if the bond principal grows you will have earned income from the bonds, and that's called interest.  You have the option of keeping some of the monthly payments and using the rest to buy additional bonds.  What may be going on is that you bought 10 year maturity bonds, and if the interest rate on bonds falls below the rate of interest offered by the bond, it is beneficial for bond holders to hold onto the bond when it matures, and re-issue it into the market.  Thus the bonds could increase in value during years when interest rates are low.  By year ten, interest rates might have caught up and the new principal offered by the new bond might be lower, and so the old bond would be worth more to the market.  That might be when you opt to cash in the bonds, which would give an additional boost in value.  However, all of this just hypothetical, and you really need to consult with a certified financial advisor"
[INST] Why some things are traded in an exchange while others are traded OTC [/INST],"There are many reasons why a market that you see as an investor would be deemed to offer sufficient liquidity for a listed instrument, whilst a less visible market is deemed to lack sufficient liquidity. One of the reasons that you may not be aware of because of the 'silent' nature of the market is that sometimes it is the case that the issuing company themselves may be selling shares. It is not necessarily the case that the shares are being bought or sold by private investors on a regular basis. They may be sold through the issuing company only every once in a while and as such the transaction size could be large and as such the liquidity could disappear very quickly. In this instance you would expect to find that there are lots of companies that are trading on a private exchange. This exchange would contain many listed stocks trading and also companies that no longer are listed as a private entity. As such the liquidity in this market is less of an issue as any issuing company could, for instance, choose not to list on the 'main' exchange and still find that they achieved all of their fund raising objectives.  The other side of this is that you may be looking at stocks that do not actually get traded that often compared to the total amount of shares issued for that specific stock. In this scenario the liquidity is low because the trading volume is low. In this instance it is often more a measure of the lack of interest in those shares as such the price would be artificially low. Companies wishing to list on an exchange will also have their shares vetted before they are allowed to become listed. This vetting process ensures that there are not excessive amounts of shares or that the company is trying to manipulate trading volume to make their stock appear popular to potential investors. This vetting process may also weed out companies that are trying to be listed on exchanges without providing accurate or valid data in respect of the number of shares outstanding and so on.   The exchange in question may have other stipulations with respect to which instruments are able to be traded through them if you wish to get listed then you would need to ensure that your share volume is high enough and that your company is deemed by the exchange as being worthy of being listed on their exchange. This may be a case of where your company has had a growth spurt as such you would not want your existing shareholders to suffer from dilution of their current share holdings. You would also want to offer an adequate level of value to current investors and potential investors in your company to prevent these persons from becoming dissatisfied with the process. In some instances there are companies that are seeking to get as much value out of the market capitalization of their instrument or companies as they can obtain and there may also be instances where they wish to take advantage of the 'recently' established liquidity of a market. The latter of which may have only recently established itself as a 'new' market and has limited trading experience to fall back on.","Trading OTC is much more complicated and risky because there is no central clearing house to trade through to match buyers and sellers. If one party does not honour and deliver what is agreed it's very hard to secure payment through the courts as you cannot enforce the terms between the two parties if they have not been written in stone. In OTC there is more risk for the parties who agree transactions. If you want to buy gold for example, you will typically have your own gold broker who then places the trade if you are a retail customer or have the appropriate license to get involved in the business of buying and selling gold. For most people buying gold it's probably the most efficient way of buying gold and getting the desired delivery (usually) of the physical gold at their local address as there are many logistical challenges about storage that many people overlook but the broker takes care of."
[INST] H&R Block says form 1120 not finalized? IRS won't take it yet? [/INST],"This is a long form that has a lot of detail so it's likely still in development. It may be quite different from prior versions so you might be better off just getting a tax accountant to use whatever tool they prefer. Also, there are usually fees for using those sites to help you prepare the form. However you're going to get the same tax advice, whether it's a free site or a paid site. You can't expect them to customize the site to your specific requirements to give you specialized help. If you can afford it - I would suggest contacting a CPA and/or attorney in your area to help you because you will have specific requirements.","From the look of things you can start the year end process, but you aren't officially supposed to file anything yet.  The tax code doesn't actually dictate the start of a new calendar year until after the date is decided by congress.  This means that you haven't technically completed the year yet and so in theory you are not supposed to start filing yet.  1120 would be what you file to report your annual income tax return for your business.  If you owe money, there's nothing you can do about it until your final taxes are due (Sept 30th in 2013) and even then the first payment isn't actually due until Jan 15 of 2014. The good news is that everything will be finalized very soon."
[INST] Is dividend taxation priced in derivatives? [/INST],"When you buy a dividend-paying stock, then part of the price that you pay is already the future dividend. The question is what would you get if you bought the non-dividend paying stock. You could sell covered calls and/or buy puts to recapture the dividend and have the added benefit of a short position on a more volatile stock (in theory). However, when exercised, the stock is returned, so if you just wanted to recapitalize the dividend, this isn't the best way (because of the time value of money and additional stock dilution effects of selling calls), but if your goal was to hedge the risk of the downside, it might be better to do so in another way. This isn't necessarily true in a corporate tax situation. If you bought the dividend, and the company did a 2:1 split, for every share you owned you would get two shares in the company at the current market price (less) the future dividend. In this case, you can see the dividend as pre-existing future profit, not as dividend tax, and it becomes easier to think of dividends in ""tax-adjusted"" terms.","The dividend is priced into the share price.  As such, options on the shares would be priced in terms of the dividend.  It is like any other underlying for the option. As such, if you bought a call and the company declared dividends, the call would be worth less due to the loss in value to the stock price by this payout. A call option on a stock that pays dividends is not a guaranteed money maker.  It all depends on the probability of the stock hitting the strike and the time value to those strike levels being worth more."
[INST] How to hedge against specific asset classes at low cost [/INST],"There are many options with lower fees, but you'll still pay something. But, that's the price for the diversification they give you.   If you're willing to move away from equity-based products then consider buying a mutual fund that invests in investment vehicles such as futures, swap agreements, options, and forwards (the alternative assets section).  These often have the lowest expense ratios in the mutual fund industry as they're much easier for the fund management to diversify with and keep the expense ratios down.  Also, if you prefer to trade yourself, consider purchasing 2 different futures contracts. That way you have some protection up/down and can diversify across futures contracts for whatever your choice market may be.  You can't get better.  If you still can manage the risk, then you could buy futures and options based on some other underlying security, but the cost in time for researching the markets and understanding the product risk will still be much higher than buying a low-fee mutual fund or ETF.   To answer your question, you can buy mutual funds, which may be cheaper than buying an ETF, but not always so.  Check the prospectus and the ETF fact sheet. You're also more likely to find a fund with the index you choose.

There are VERY low-cost ETFs (i.e. VGT has a .16% expense ratio), but very high-cost (i.e. PFA has a 1.05% expense ratio).  The cost of an ETF is likely to be comparable to a future that is diversified in a similar asset class.   I suggest opening a 401K account and contributing (for the tax deferrals) and the investment choices.  Most 401K plans give you the full array of investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs etc.) and they often have much lower expense ratios because they give you access to the fund ""in house"" management fees.","Investors must be careful not to buy index funds in one country but derivatives in another, such as European or United States equity indexes. This combination of indexes might in the end not track the overall market and may in fact not achieve the desired purpose of minimizing costs.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversification_(finance)  In addition to this, many investors use ETFs to take advantage of the benefits of passive stock management.  http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange-traded-fund.asp"
[INST] Can I use same stock broker to buy stocks from different stock markets? [/INST],"You can make your own choice between many brokers. I would suggest checking for any restrictions they have on trading shares of a particular country and trading volume (e.g. my broker lets me trade only 500 shares per day for each company).  If I was investing in something that was more expensive, I would expect the broker to charge me a different rate.  My broker charged me 2.5% for a share of Apple stock, for example.  As one suggestion, you can start by filtering brokers based on what countries they offer stock purchases in. The other suggestion I would make is to not use your broker as your sole information source; there are many free tools that help you research the market.","Yes. If you use the correct exchange abbreviation in IB, such as the ones listed below: EAS  –  Eastern European  NSE  –  National Stock Exchange of India NZS  –  New Zealand  OAX  –  OAXACA SIM – Small and Micro Stocks of the Colombian Market   MM – Milan Merchant   LJ – Ljubljana Stock Exchange (Slovenia)   BX – Brussels                 There are many more on the main website.

"[INST] In double entry book-keeping, how should I record writing of a check? [/INST]",There two ways you can record the transaction.   1.   You can record it separately.  You deposit  the check and remove your bank account accordingly.   You record  the expense and write the check in your Cash account.  If the expense  is more than the amount being deposited the balance will go negative if all checks are written out.  2.  You can record the total amount of cash being deposited.  Since you entered the check number into  your checkbook you can keep track of which deposit to  apply the check to (the deposit number)  and when you know the  amount you can make addons to individual entries if necessary.  If you use option 2 your cash account will always be positive and your creditors happy.,"A check is an obligation and is not an asset, it's a liability. I have recorded in the past the payee and amount of a business check as an account ""checks payable"" (the liability) and a sub account with the payee name (the expense). Later when I deposited the check I recorded its number as an account ""check received"" (the asset) and a sub account with the payee name (receiving revenue, i.e.: income). This keeps everything separate, but some people prefer recording a check as if it were an asset, but I always have to stop them from doing so, because it is a liability and this way it will always look that way."
[INST] How can an Indian citizen get exposure to global markets? [/INST],I have two suggestions:,"The other options, with low to no cost involve taking on some currency risk if you do not have an interest in the currency of the country you are holding the investments in.  The currency risk of the country you are in (India) vs the country of the investment should be something you are willing to take on.  If you do not already hold some foreign currency, there is also likely a lot more risk, in the form of higher possible losses in the short term in that currency.   Index ETFs such as Vanguard's ETFS.   The most important thing is to learn how invest and pick your style, you need to understand which is riskier, being in the country where the value goes up more (or down less, during bad times), or holding the investments themselves, or the risk of the investment going sideways, which often correlates with the market as a whole, the best option would be to combine them all."
[INST] Downside to temporarily lowering interest rates? [/INST],"When a company increases its yield, it signals that its business outlook is improving.  That increase in interest rate indicates more optimism that the company will need cash in the future.  So when a company decreases its interest rate, it decreases the cash it will need.  It may decrease the amount of financing it desires for the future. The decrease in debt financing is a sign of decreased optimism for the company.   I will guess that most, but not all, reasons to decreasing the interest rate are a change in the perceived risk that will result in a change in the interest rate offered.  The company now sees a lesser risk.","Credit cards usually have variable interest rates. It may be that some consumers have been having trouble making payments, so raising rates doesn't help, but lowering rates gives the impression that the banks are not overly concerned. It also increases consumer confidence."
[INST] Why can't 401(k) statements be delivered electronically? [/INST],"I believe the paper version is the default, although this appears to be changing.  I would think that 401(k) funds have a legal obligation to have audited paper records in the form of the 401(k) statements and that it would be easier to comply with those requirements with paper statements. Many people with whom I have traded (and I have over a decade of experience in the game) would prefer the statements in paper form, claiming that they will lose money if they rely exclusively on automated online statements. My father is one of these people, whose brokerage accounts went from having positive, albeit small, equity to all negative equity, and he had to pay for years for that mistake to disappear.  However, I had a colleague who lost a considerable amount of money because he received paper statements instead of electronic statements and was late in discovering that.  The SEC has also gotten on the bandwagon, announcing in the fall of 2010 that it is investigating how to mandate paper 401(k) statements.  I am betting that if paper is made the default, they're going to figure that out.  See the SEC press release.","401K plans usually have a wide range of employees, especially those which are very large and have employees spread around the country. Most 401K plans are administered via local banks or credit unions, but most of the bank accounts being funded are held at a larger bank with locations spread around the country. These larger banks may be part of what is called an ABLE network, which is an alliance of banks that are able to provide banking services to each other's customers remotely, although sometimes with limitations around certain fees applied or other differences. A bank in one city may serve as trustee, as custodian, as broker, etc.. of a 401K, but a participant will have a relationship with a local bank that has some presence in the area of employment. As such, statements are often mailed via regular mail to the address indicated on the profile for the account."
[INST] Alternative to Jumbo Mortgage [/INST],"Another option for people in your position is to ask if your state has a Housing Finance Agency (HFA) such as MassHousing or CALHFA. The HFA offers special programs that sometimes allow you to access a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loan with a debt ratio of up to 40%. They also offer conventional loans at 3%, for 40% of the county median income, with debt ratios as high as 50%. These are often a great alternative to FHA loans.","Your house was appraised for 280K by a reputable appraiser so the issue is with the bank.  They are underwriting you based on the 180K loan or some portion of that amount.   Your issue is not with your bank.  Your issue is with the seller.  The seller is either unwilling to sell now or isn't willing to go lower.  They may have to reconsider because you have the cashflow to support the additional expense.  If not then it's just time.   It's a buyer's market.  That means you have 10 or 20 buyers for every home for sale.   They should be able to sell that condo tomorrow, if they lower the asking price.  If not then you just have to come up with enough cashflow from your current resources to buy it next year.  You can do that by saving up, refinancing the old condo to make more room in the budget or by selling off some investments to make room in your accounts.   If you find a better deal on a one bedroom condo then you can try to refinance your existing condo using it as collateral.  Alternatively, it may still make sense to finance part of that purchase with a 2nd mortgage.  It's a market where you'd have to have another 15-20 buyers lining up to meet your price. It's a buyer's market."
[INST] Do query services like Google Finance and Yahoo Finance go back to correct busted and adjusted trades? [/INST],"Google Finance was not updating the historical data of the company.  The financial results were updated, but the 3D chart that used to show stock price on X-axis and date on the Y-axis has not been updated. I sent a feedback message to Google to that effect. Yahoo Finance has its history updated, at the following address: http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MSFT I am not aware of any other sites that allow you to customize your own charts. I have not tried Yahoo Finance, because after their last revamp the charts were so poor that I switched to Google.

"[INST] Other than being able to borrow to invest, how is a margin trading account different from a cash account? [/INST]","I would like to add/emphasize something @John pointed out.  Many people will tell you that you are essentially 'borrowing stock' when in margin accounts and it's as if you are borrowing other people's money to double your investment capital. This is an illusion. The fact is, most brokerages do not loan you the stock. They use the funds that you put in the account as first-dollar collateral, which is then borrowed by the brokerage from a bank. This, then, enables the brokerage to loan out the remainder of the cash that you requested for margin in the first place. In other words, if you put in $10,000 and requested to go long on $100,000 worth of shares with 90% margin, you would be funding the transaction for yourself, the broker, and your fellow investors. The broker is going to loan you $9,000 cash and put that cash back in the trading accounts of the shareholders that you're buying stock from. Your cash will stay in your broker's account to serve as collateral so that he can then borrow a 'bunch' of trading capital and loan it out to you to buy the stock from. This whole operation is then insured, by the SEC, since stock is considered the only asset whose liquidation could threaten a brokerage. A bank may or may not allow you to borrow to buy stock. This is called a margin purchase by the bank and may or may not have the same requirements as a brokerage margin purchase. For example: if your brokerage says that you must have 90% margin, but the bank allows you to borrow with 80% margin, the bank will require a different cash balance.","The main advantage of a margin account is that it allows you to borrow stock. This has many advantages: In this case you have your money working for you, and you don't even have to know what to invest in; it gets allocated and invested for you. That's one of the reasons the market keeps going up: it's because people are borrowing and buying shares. But there are many disadvantages: If you're invested in stocks, it puts you and your broker at risk, whereas if you have cash, your broker is the one at risk since you're insured if your broker goes bankrupt.  And you might notice that when there's a big market downturn, cash investments are much safer (you get to use the cash to offset losses), while leveraged positions are not (you risk going into liquidation)."
[INST] What is the best strategy for after hours trading? [/INST],"It is better to have something than nothing in case it helps. I've been using the strategy for a few years now and it's paid off nicely. One can't beat the market in an efficient market, but I believe one can make money consistently. I'd like to think, if I'd followed my strategy since the start of time, I'd be a billionaire. But it's been a gradual progression up to this point.  Anyway, the strategy is fairly simple: I sell the 1, 2, and 5 year bond futures when they are at their highest yield (within the last few years, this has corresponded to high yields for the time period), and then when all three future yields are low, I buy them.  I sell bonds when they are above 4%, buy them when they are at 0.5%, for both the 1 year, 2 year, and 5 year.  It's been successful for me so far, although I wish I had started the strategy a longer time ago, I will stick to it as it has been working, and continue to use stops. I use the CFTC/CME data at dailyfx and set triggers for buying when the bond future hits 0.50% or lower. I sell when it hits 4%. I also put stops on my trades, to prevent big losses and take some profit off the table, by selling 1/3 of the position when a long hits 0.75% profit target.  And when a short hits -3% profit target, to cut losses and take some profit off the table by selling 1/3 of the short.  So far in 2011, the strategy has worked so far up to mid May 2011. I use an equal weight allocation to 1 year and 5 year bonds. I've made lots of small gains and no huge losses with it so far, and its gotten me through the entire financial crisis, where many were saying 2011 is going to be even worse then 2008 was.","I agree with the other answers. Investing over the night is not a good strategy. So as to not get bored with this topic I'll offer you some more details and insights on this topic as to why I suggest you do what you are doing: If you do decide to trade at night take the time to learn how to trade, before you decide to risk real money, learn in a SIM or paper trading mode. Learn to understand the patterns of your indicators and how to choose your targets. Then learn to choose your entry and exit and to use stop losses for risk control. Trading after hours is a different animal to day trading. So the advice I gave on day trading doesn't apply so directly to night trading. You could day trade before your regular trading session if you felt the need to. Otherwise learn to use the SIM to practice and test different ideas during night time. I really could go on about why after market trading is not a good idea, I have to restrain myself as the list is endless. Here is just a few reasons: At night you will be competing against a very large number of traders, and some sophisticated ones at that.  Why would you want to compete again people that have studied the markets for years and know every trick there is? Why would you want to compete again people who have access to technology that you could never dream of having. I don't think there is a single person reading this who knows enough about the markets to compete with these traders to trade against. You will probably end up losing a lot of money before you realise you are getting your trading ass kicked and give up in frustration. There are plenty of markets to trade in during  day time. You can find ones where the traders do not use stop losses and ones you can use them to your advantage. For example using a trailing stop in the Forex market would be an ideal use of stop losses. But why use them if there is no reason to do so. If you are trading on a sim now, good, that will help you learn how to trade the normal daytime market hours. Just try and use trading hours your country uses as it will be easier to trade without the time differences. So when you do start trading think of trading in the hours your country is awake and trading."
[INST] Covered Call Writing - What affects the price of the options? [/INST],"In general: Yes, a covered call is more safe than a naked call (since at least the buyer has some money in the option) but is less lucrative (since you get no dividends and are buying the stock). The best way to think of it is as taking income for limiting your upside.  To get at the cost-of-carry questions:","First of all a bit of technical explanation of how options are priced. A call option is an amount of money that the stock owner in effect sells to the option buyer today, while the amount of money is the stock's strike price multiplied by its amount of shares. So, for example, if shares of a stock currently cost $5, a call option giving the option holder the right to buy the stock at $15 (that's, its strike price) will cost $100. The strike price will be established on the day the option is written, based on some formula (such as the average of the stock's previous close price on 3 consecutive days, which is how options contracts are priced on the NASDAQ). It may be possible for the owner of the option to exercise it, which means purchasing the stock at the agreed upon price ($15 in the example above), if the strike price exceeds the current price that the stock is trading at, and the option holder decides that it is a good deal. However, the option holder does not have to exercise the options if they choose not to; in some cases they have a number of options (against the strikes and expiration dates) so they may choose to let the option lapse. If the stock were trading at $25, the holder would pass on the option and only $10 of the $100 paid for the option would be lost. But they'd still be out that $10. The value of the option can actually be broken down into two parts. The first part is called the intrinsic value, or the ""in the money"" value. This part is the amount of money that a buyer who exercises the call option would gain from owning the stock at the strike price, compared to buying the stock at the current market price. (i.e. $15-$25 is a ""loss"" of $10 on the in the money part.) The second part is the extrinsic value (called time value). How much of the price is intrinsic value and how much is time value is affected by how much the stock is likely to rise between now and the expiration date of the option. It is also affected by other factors, which may include the stock's volatility, how likely it is that the strike price will be exceeded, and interest rates, among other things. The time value is the most likely part of the price of the call option to respond to economic news. In this case, a report that the company's results were better than expected will typically indicate that it's less likely that the stock will fall by future earnings announcements, as the company may have ""sunk the costs"" that prevent them from reporting further poor earnings. Since the option holder will exercise the option if and only if the strike price is exceeded, and won't pay more than $15, the option holder is only interested in the likelihood that the stock will reach $15 at any point during the period before the expiration date, not the likelihood of it exceeding $15 before the expiration date in 11 months' time. But the extrinsic value can also be affected by news about the company that causes a change in sentiment in the market place. Say the company announces that they have a new drug that has 33% better results in clinical trials. It's the case that they may also find out during later trials that this drug may not be as effective as they first believed. Perhaps the tests are only on a small number of people. So although the time value is impacted by news that may have a bearing upon the likelihood that the stock price will reach $15, it may also be affected by what you believe the market as a whole may believe that company's prospects. If an analyst revises their price target for Gilead Sciences, this may have an impact on the time value of calls options, independent of any news about the company that would impact the time value even without the analyst revision. And you can't ignore the possibility that the analyst revision may simply be an excuse to buy calls against the company. So what does the market tell you and what does your opinion have to do with it? Some companies have options that have a high time value due to the fact that the industry they're in, may have an above the market average amount of new scientific breakthrough, and the market is less able to ascertain which news will be good. Biotech firms generally operate in this arena, having one small positive announcement may trigger a re-evaluation of all their research, resulting in a general increase in the market price for these firms, which in turn can result in increased time value for options against them.

[INST] How to trade “exotic” currencies? [/INST],"Yes, you can buy it on a stock exchange (the ""spot""), but you have to know people who have access to it.  The problem is that there are very few people trading it.  Also, there are very few people who have an agreement with the Central Bank of the currency you wish to buy. The spot market is, in essence, currency trade that does not include a future time element.  In the spot market you buy the money for the current value, not for a future date.  All money is priced at the rate it is currently trading at.  If you want to buy Australian dollars, you would look at the spot price currently being offered by the market.  You could negotiate with the seller and agree to a different exchange rate, but the trade would execute on the spot. While spot markets are active for most currencies, few people trade ""exotic currencies"".  For that market to even exist is evidence that there are investors who want them and investors who have them. You say you are not trying to ""play the market"" and neither do I.  I buy currency for personal use, not to speculate on the price of the currency. The only way I can see it being useful to people like us is to be able to buy it at the current price when and where we want it, with minimal transaction fees.","It is very easy to trade in any particular currency today.  You really don't need to be physically located in any certain geographic location any more to take advantage of exchange rates, though being a citizen of a currency you are investing in still has inherent benefits that should be taken into consideration.  You just need to have an online broker.  You can buy anything you want with any of them.  I would recommend looking at Interactive Brokers.  They offer multiplier access to pretty much anything you could want to invest in.  They are also very reasonably priced for the amount of currency you would be trading in each month.  Of course, there is always the FX Rate Fees to take into consideration, but I think you will find the rate a lot more favorable than any other banks give you in the US.  If you are looking for a more aggressive investment then there are many hedge funds and other entities that are willing to trade in very exotic currency pairings.  Again all you need other than a reasonable amount of starting capital is access to a broker that offers multiplier access to the currencies in question."
[INST] Track uninvoiced (pre-invoiced?) expected income in Quicken [/INST],"I track income this way: The balance in that account will show all your outstanding income. If you haven't made a sale and created an invoice, your income isn't ""E"" expected (because you don't ""expect"" to bill for services you haven't performed), it's in a ""P"" (pending) state and the balance showing in this account will show you what's pending - money you've recorded that you're going to bill.  If a customer pays you money in advance, it's part of your revenue (so record that as revenue), but if a customer pays you part of a bill amount in advance, that income should be subtracted from the bill amount.  It might be helpful if you track your accounts this way: If you use Quickbooks Online, you may or may not like that program, but when I ran a business for several years, I found it very useful.  I actually recommend paying for the online version, but for tracking your business's financial status you can do so for free using their mobile app.","It is true that you cannot track the un-invoiced in QIF format. That is because the QIF data-format of QIF uses the account balances to track everything: deposits and withdrawals. So as soon as you create an Income account, that account has the balance representing your invoiced income. If you track the money (in QIF/QIF exported format) coming in from your customers in the income account, then the balance in the income account is the income already received. So all QIF compliant formats cannot have non-zero balances on accounts. Also if you add the un-invoiced income to the income account through the income, it'll get added to the balance again. So that also is not allowed. Your best bet is to keep your actual income and invoices in Quicken and keep track of your un-invoiced income in a ledger on a spreadsheet, or a spreadsheet that supports QIF format."
[INST] How can I invest in an index fund but screen out (remove) certain categories of socially irresponsible investments? [/INST],"To invest in S&P Index of  Environmental, Socially and Governance Index (ESG) funds or ETFs follow the instruction below: The S&P 500® is a free-float market cap weighted representation of the 500 large-cap US companies and meets the requirements of being a suitable index for a US Index fund. To get a mutual fund or ETF that replicates this Index you need to find a fund/ETF that: I know of a number that does this such as Tangerine's eco ETF portfolio. The only problem with it is that it does rebalance throughout the year unlike the passive index approach. So you can get a better performance if you do it via yourself using low-cost mutual funds. See my question on how to do it: How can I replicate S&P 500 ESG Index's performance but with lower fees?","A company like Vanguard actually has a series of index funds which only use screened stocks. That's a very simple solution - you could get a Vanguard Index fund and remove the S and P 500 index funds for example, by using their ESG Index fund. You could do the same with other companies. There are plenty of companies that you can invest in."
[INST] How to fill the IRS Offer In Compromise with an underwater asset? [/INST],"If a lender has repossessed an asset or placed a lien on property, or a judge has issued a money judgement or seizure order against you, then you cannot include that property on your Offer.

[INST] Does reading financial statements (quarterly or annual reports) really help investing? [/INST],"There are two distinct questions asked here: (i) is reading financial statements ""worth my time"" and (ii) should I use them to make my investment decisions.   I will give an answer to each in turn for the sake of completeness. As @JoeTaxpayer hinted at, question (i) comes down to a number of different factors, most of which are irrelevant on the whole. Firstly it is important to realize that your time has a value (in terms of other uses you could put your time towards). The value of your time is defined by how much you would have to be paid (in some form) (e.g. money, food/drink in a restaurant) in order for you to undertake some activity for which you would receive no direct income. This will obviously vary hugely between individuals and in a similar way it is in your 'best interest' to find one or more activities (or combinations thereof) that makes best use of your skills or abilities. As the cost of getting information becomes lower, it is increasingly becoming the case that more and more individuals are able to receive more and more information because their cost of receiving and processing that information is less. How much time are you willing to put in to receive the gains from the increase in your knowledge, or the time spent seeking to reduce your losses. If you have a good grasp of information, you can spend more time processing the information received so are able to gain much more from the same amount of information and so on... Obviously the quality of that information you receive is very variable to, and as Joe has commented the quality of the time you choose to spend processing data will effect the benefits you receive.","Yes. And no. As always, it depends. Many people that invest in stocks will use a ""passive"" strategy, where they invest in a stock mutual fund and let the fund manager (or the market) take care of picking the ""right"" stocks for them. If this is the case, reading financial statements could be a waste of time. Some will use an ""active"" investment approach, where individual stocks are chosen by the investor (or the investor has an adviser that does the choosing). In this situation, reading financial statements is indispensible. When I buy stock in a company, I'm buying a portion of that company. I'm becoming a stakeholder in that company. I want to understand the company. I want to understand what the company is doing, what the company hopes to do, if there are major risks or problems with the company, to read the annual report like a child that is going to learn to read for the first time, and get excited about it. I'll also read it repeatedly, because there is always something new to see, and my understanding of the company will be enhanced with each passing reading. I like to see the trends, so that I know what to expect out of the company, and can know when to get out (or in) of the stock. If a company has always had a problem with customer retention, I'll realize that with the new marketing manager in place for 6 months, I'm not likely to see that problem disappear any time soon - and when it does, that will not be the result of the current marketing manager. A few of the things I'll look for will be if the company is still run by the founder - does he seem to be out of touch, and is the company following a different vision now? Does the company seem to be following a strategy that will eventually leave them without any market niche? Does the company have a plan to stay profitable, or do I see a history of major cutbacks in spending? All of this information can help me decide when to sell out of a stock and get out of that company. (I also look at things like new product development timelines, the ability of the company to keep costs down, market trends, etc...). In a nutshell, I think that the ""real"" benefits of learning to read financial statements come from knowing the trends of the particular business. It's sort of like reading a book - once you know the first few pages, much of the information on the rest of the pages will make sense, but without knowing what went before, it would all be gibberish."
[INST] Money market account for emergency savings [/INST],"I've held a money market account for the last 3 years, but I am looking to upgrade to something a bit better. If you want to keep all your money in one place, you should probably switch to an Online Savings Account. If you are OK with splitting up the funds, then you can invest in the stock market or other investments. You can invest in stocks using a broker like Interactive Brokers (IBKR), but I don't recommend that for Emergency Savings, as stocks tend to be high risk and low yield investments (although in the past couple of weeks, one of the biggest risks (stock market collapse) has been realized). Other options include GICS sector ETFs (like XLP or XLV) or a balanced ETF like DWSE or DWSE-3H which has 50% in the Dow 30, 30% in International, 10% US Treasury Bonds and 10% Corporate Bonds. However, those are medium to high risk and should probably only be used for ""less important"" parts of your money.","In addition to the reasons your original commentators point out, MMAs are very liquid as compared with other account types such as taxable money market funds or even tax exempt ones.   You can get to the money quickly when it is the account type you keep your emergency fund in. You may choose to buy a CD and lock into a certain rate in return for less liquidity, but you have a choice. There are not many options where you can lock in your rate and still keep your cash in a liquid, easily accessible place. Another thing to make sure you have is a reasonable rate of return. Most money market funds (both in bank accounts and those offered by brokerage companies and other financial firms) are going to be very safe and liquid, but provide you with a rate of return in a range of 2 to 3 percent or a money account is now going to earn you next to nothing. If your current MMA account is at a rate where you are earning enough to meet your goals (and to be competitive versus inflationary pressures) then maybe you don't need to search anymore."
[INST] Transfer from credit to debit [/INST],"Unfortunately, debit card purchases and credit card purchases do not net out perfectly. That is, if you spend $10 one day, then $11 the next, those don't net out to -$1. Instead, something like 2% of the credit card purchase is subtracted from your debit card, and I'm afraid I don't know the formula offhand. At the bank we use, the fee is 200%, so if I pay $3 with a debit card, $5 will subtract from my account. If I pay $10 with a credit card, $2 will subract from my account. So you probably want more than one debit purchase to cover the amount.","I don't really think there is such a thing as a credit or debit card. They are all issued by banks, whether you know you are using a Visa or a Mastercard the bank gets their cut by charging the merchant for a percentage of the sale. You need to look at the payment method.  When I have my debit Visa card it is my bank, the money is in my account. When I use my credit from Mastercard the money isn't in my account. The important thing is what type of card you want. If it all comes out of your bank account you have a transaction, you can see it on your bank statement and the retailer gets charged for the transaction. That's debit. If you plan to pay the money back on another date, it is credit."
"[INST] If a stock doesn't pay dividends, then why is the stock worth anything? [/INST]","This is actually a good time to remind people of the importance of understanding investing before putting any hard cash into the stock market. While it is certainly possible to make money buying stocks -- and some people do very well at it (just ask Warren Buffet) -- many people are simply not going to do as well as a professional market analyst would be and/or might end up having their invested money disappear entirely as a result of bad investments. As a warning, this question is a little confusing -- it seems the user is conflating the words ""earnings"" and ""dividends"". The only thing a company is legally obligated to pay its stockholders is dividends. However, dividends come from profits, which are company earnings after all of its expenses have been paid (investing in a business also allows investors to share in the increase in company assets). A stock is worth as much as the company is worth, regardless of whether earnings are paid out to investors or retained back in the company (although companies should not retain ""too much"" -- it will make their stock worthless). If a company's earnings keep increasing, its stock market value will keep increasing. The real question should instead be: if a company isn't paying dividends, why should I buy its stock? This question brings up an interesting point that is important in investing -- should you invest in a company only for the dividends it might pay, or should you invest in the company itself for its profits, and accept that dividends (or the lack of them) are merely one benefit of doing so? Many people investing in the stock market do so specifically for dividends. However, many more invest in the stock market for other reasons: for diversification, for investing in the long-term potential of a company or market sector, or to take advantage of expected price swings/changes.","Well, basically the other answer says a good part of the answer - the share should be worth something if dividends are paid at least partially from some real underlying assets. i.e. money from the sale of the product (the business itself) but not simply out of other people's money or loans taken, and that is a lot of IFs.  You might be thinking that if a company doesn't pay a dividend, it is essentially stealing your money, which is simply not true at all. First of all, companies reinvest those profits on growing the business. While I wouldn't say they keep the company forever, the whole point of investing in a company is to help it grow, and eventually sell it. The dividend pay-out ratio should reflect on the profitability of the business, and I don't think anybody will dispute that a business growing at 10 times the dividend rate will be much profitable than the one that is growing at barely 1 time the dividend rate. For that reason the company might actually be using the money in building up a new factory or in buying some assets that will grow the business, but not in paying you dividends. At least not yet.  However, this argument only covers reinvesting for profitability. It does not cover the risk of the business. The riskier the business is, the less money you should be giving it to grow, as your chances of receiving the profits you are expecting become lower and lower. This should also apply to those businesses that have been around for a long time, say 100 years and above. If you look at the share price on a long-run chart, such as the one shown below for Coca-Cola, you would notice that the value has been pretty volatile historically, especially in the early 1920s and a time around 1980. However, after some period of time, the prices went back to normal, or to the trend line shown on the chart. Therefore, if the price of a share that is 100 years old and has been paying little dividends until now stays the same, the management is doing what they can to make this trend return and keep the investors happy.  On the other hand, as you suggested, people buy shares with the expectation that the company will keep paying dividends, and thus will sell them. Therefore the company makes more money, and is able to reinvest more into their business. However, to keep paying increasing dividends means that they have to keep selling shares. This is another reason why they should not be paying too high a dividend.  Finally, as much as some people hate Apple, the company currently is worth more than both the GDP of its native country, the US, and the whole of China. They have been reinvesting all their money in order to become the biggest consumer electronics company in the world. The share price has been extremely volatile in the past, but over the last two years Apple has been paying no dividends. It is possible they will do so in the future, and possibly very attractive for people to start buying shares of Apple. But they might reinvest the money for future developments. Either way, the stock should not be devaluing if they are reinvesting the money, and if the dividend payout ratio does increase. What do you think? I hope I have covered all the basic questions you asked, and I hope you found it useful. Thanks for reading."
"[INST] Boyfriend is coowner of a house with his sister, he wants to sell but she doesn't [/INST]","Can't the sister take the house away from them both because they haven't paid the mortgage? Do your lawyer due diligence -- I wouldn't just rely on what your boyfriend tells you. You need to get the whole story and the documents to back it up.  From what you're telling us, it sounds like your boyfriend is trying to get out of his obligation to repay the mortgage without giving you anything.  The sister may also have other expectations besides monetarily of the sale, e.g. a desire to keep it in the family, or because she currently lives there.  Get information on all these issues. Also: The house would have been placed in an irrevocable trust and the terms of the sale would have been laid out in advance.  You wouldn't be able to sell without all the siblings agreeing, but you might be able to sell if your sisters were all dead and all the other heirs agreed to a sale.  The wills of the 2 siblings would have a clause in them stating who to give the property to in the case of their death.","I suspect you know that this type of situation is ripe for legal action, and that it won't be pretty if the legal fight does indeed get underway. It's not possible to estimate the costs you'd need for a 100% legal solution.  If you are in the US, you may be able to get legal help at a free clinic, but if you live in an expensive urban area, the wait times may be long. The cost of attorney's fees may be significant even for relatively inexperienced lawyers who take it on as a learning experience.  Even in small claims court, most judges will not give time-constraints, nor will they do anything to dissuade parties from pursuing expensive and/or frivolous lawsuits.  I'm sure the cost of filing fees in small claims court and related filing fees, etc. for subsequent paperwork.  Also, you may be legally bound to pay your boyfriend's share of the mortgage and other expenses since you are now a co-owner.  This doesn't even begin to count any additional expenses that you'll probably incur as you continue to attempt to share the house with your ex-boyfriend. So... if you're in the US, the National Association of Consumer Advocates website might be able to help you track down free legal help in your area.  If you're in the UK, Citizen's Advice Bureau may be able to help you determine what you can/should do in any sort of legal regard, although the costs for hiring legal help in the UK for such a matter would be similar, if not higher, than in the US.  I strongly suggest you discuss this entire situation with them and/or a lawyer specialising in land titles in your local area."
[INST] How to know more about my tax situation in the States [/INST],"No, you owe nothing at all to U.S. income taxes because you have lived and worked abroad the entire time (and been living outside of the U.S. since November 2018). Your employer most likely automatically calculated taxes assuming that you were still a U.S. citizen and a U.S. resident. The IRS requires that a U.S. person pay U.S. income tax on worldwide income, but the requirements to file U.S. tax returns, U.S. gift tax, and U.S. income tax are specific to whether you can prove that you have broken ties with the U.S. I'm going to assume that you paid tax in your country of residence, and paid U.S. gift tax and income tax prior to November 2018. That information would prove that you do indeed meet the requirements. There is nothing more than the tax returns and U.S. passport you would need to file form 8833 as a former resident alien indicating how and when you met those requirements. If however you owe income tax in your country of residence then your situation may be complex, and possibly require professional tax support. You will need to pay either form 1040X or form 1040NR, and form 4868 to avoid the failure-to-file penalty. I would strongly urge you to go to an expatriate tax attorney and explain your situation in specific detail. If you are no longer working for an employer, and have no income to pay you will need to tell the IRS via mail that you have no income to declare. You will need to pay a foreign earned income exclusion, form 2555, form 2555-EZ (if required to file), form 709 (if required to file), form 2350 (if qualified) and form 843 (if qualified). The cost for all this advice will probably cost you much more than the cost of not paying taxes because of your failure to file on time.","You've already started on the right track.  You just need now to take initiative and make it happen. There are a number of resources from the State of California that you can use to help you figure out what you need to do to meet Californian requirements. One such document that you'll want to pay attention to is the Personal Income Tax Checklist, which has a nice table of contents that lets you get right to what you need to find out in the first place.  There are additional references to other resources in the various sections as well.  For example, in section 6 there's a link to the fact sheet discussing the California Nonresident and Part-Year Resident Income Tax Return. But it's far from exhaustive. There really is no substitute for calling these offices and asking questions. The main sources of information are:  There is plenty of free research information available online as well from the website for the California state government.  Just look for publications that have been published within the last two years, and you'll have the most recent guidance. Of course, California law isn't everything here, you also have the IRS to deal with.  But there's a good chance that once you have those two questions answered by those two agencies, you'll have a good idea for what you need to know to get IRS compliance. Good luck with this.  And, please, don't just give up when you don't get what you want from an outside source.  They're going to require you to go through them anyway, so you might as well take advantage of them now. And, when you're done, remember that you can do a lot of good by giving back to your community through donations to charities.  You can find a lot of information about charities that you can get involved with through GuideStar.org.  A lot of them provide tax-break incentives for donations, but the goodwill you get is worth the cost of the tax saving alone."
[INST] Mortgage vs. Cash for U.S. home buy now [/INST],"You need to factor in your annual tax rates when making such calculations. Also the rates you quote are annual interest rates, so you would be quoting monthly rates which for 14% should be around 1.14%. You should be aware that your interest rates are unlikely to be that low in the UK and in fact may be higher for the 10 year period.   When making such calculations, you need to take into account  all tax you pay during the periods of 16 years (assuming you have a 15 year amortization on your property, paying on a monthly basis) and 14 years (paying monthly on your US property). You also need to factor in the exchange rate you are using between GBP and USD at the time of each transaction. There are also other transactional fees and possible capital gains taxes that you need to factor in. In addition, if your UK mortgage allows you to take out mortgage insurance that may lower your monthly costs. Such insurance may also be available in the US mortgage market. It is entirely possible that taking a cash payout from your pensions could increase the amount of tax you pay each year.   In short these are not like for like comparisons, especially whilst your pensions are invested in equities. Also taking into account potential house price increases/decreases and transaction costs for each.","It's better to get the loan.  But not by much, really.  We're really talking about 10-15k, so for me, that's not enough of a savings to really be worth all the paperwork.  If you have a good credit rating, I would just skip the cash part of the transaction, get the loan done, and use the cash on something useful. The one thing I would agree with your father is doing a 15 year term vs 30 year. Your monthly payment will be higher, but you'll pay $10-15K less in interest and you'll own it in half the time. The other thing worth considering is you'll be done paying it just about the time you are looking to buy the next home.  If you get a 30 year, you may have to refi or come up with another 20% downpayment for the next place just as you are still paying off the last one.  But yeah, don't take the cash for the $5k and then have to pay back $60K in mortgage later.  I've seen this happen a few times.  Then they get 30 years instead of 15, or 15 at 4.5%, and all of sudden, they need to refi to 3% and it costs them 2K every 30 days, just so they can sleep at night. As an aside, I'd be careful about what you put in the house. There probably isn't much demand for a full on home entertainment system.  This will be nice to rent out to other short-term tenants if it comes to that, but otherwise it could just look really gaudy.  It would be a shame to go to your home inspection, and have the inspector walk out the door and go, ""Oh, and the home theater system is worth about $3,000. Are you aware of that?  We should get that deducted off of the price."""
[INST] Why would you not want to rollover a previous employer's 401(k) when changing jobs? [/INST],"Because in some cases keeping the retirement investment funds in the 401(k) may give you certain advantages, such as:  Depending upon the job, you may not want to move the retirement funds, especially if it is going a different company (and therefore a different investment advisor).  In my case, I don't want to have to deal with that type of hassle, so I leave my current retirement funds where they are, and start new ones.  Your choices are: 1: Just start the new retirement accounts from scratch. 2: Roll into a company/spouse qualified plan. 3: Rollover some or all of it into an IRA.  No matter what you decide the first step is to calculate what your fees and expenses in each of the above options will be.  If you're going to be paying the company in fees to maintain the account, you really should compare the fees (both hidden and obvious) to other options to make an intelligent decision.","I disagree with the comments saying the advice is only good if you have a Roth 401k. Having a Traditional 401k as an option is what makes this advice good. With a traditional 401k, your money grows tax free and you owe income tax when you withdraw it. However if you roll the Traditional 401k into an IRA, you make the withdrawal 100% tax free (meaning that you owe no taxes on the part that your previous employer paid). So let's say you invest $25k in your Traditional 401k and you're in the 25% bracket; when you get your distribution at 65, if you roll it to your IRA you would owe $6250 in income tax. Let's also assume your income puts you in the 25% bracket while you work, so for every dollar you invest in your IRA your withdrawal at 65 will have $1 less in taxes (since part of your income is tax free). So when you roll your 401k into your IRA you will essentially reap that 25% tax savings all the way into retirement, which adds up! This can have a big impact on your withdrawal amount, assuming you hold the investments in a similar way - if you invested your Traditional 401k and rolled it into your Roth IRA, and you invested your Roth 401k into a Traditional IRA, you could still hold both accounts the exact same way. If you are already rolling all or much of your income tax free, it will not be as big of a change in your withdrawal amount to roll the Traditional 401k into an IRA. That said, I think the biggest value comes from the re-investment in the IRA, because there is a risk you take back when you roll the Traditional 401k to your Roth IRA. If you plan on staying in the lower brackets, it's not so much of a risk."
[INST] What percentage of my company should I have if I only put money? [/INST],"100% ownership can be very risky.  I've seen so many companies in trouble over the years in which there may have been just one bad apple that ruined it for everyone.  If you have more skin in the game than everyone else there certainly can be incentive for other partners/shareholders to act differently if they know it will really cost them their job, for example.  Another area it can get dicey is if one partner has more equity than everyone else.  Sometimes, that partner thinks they are entitled to more, and this can create problems if there is no mechanism in place to distribute revenues/losses, etc.  As the others said here, it is definitely important to set up some operating rules if a partnership is to last, and it's best to do so early in the game before problems arise.  You should spend time looking at other agreements and figuring out what's the best setup for your company.  There are so many types: equity partners sharing revenue, equity partners with voting power, non-equity partners, etc etc...  Also, it may be better to set up the company with a board of directors that helps oversee the company.  Not saying it's needed, but it may help get things settled among founding members when disagreements arise.","First, don't do it that way. You should be receiving shares for your efforts, not selling them. Having said that, the amount of ownership that you have will be impacted by many factors, to give one example, if after x amount of year the company raises money you might be diluted in that process or even ousted, especially if they bring on professional investors."
[INST] What is the meaning of “writing put options”? [/INST],"""Writing put options"" refers to creating a new (unexercised) put option. It works like this: Suppose the stock trades at $20 when you sell a put at $10 (with an exercise price of $10). You receive a premium of $2/share, and you have no obligation until the buyer decides to exercise or expires. But, suppose someone offers you $0.50/share to buy your $10 (with an exercise price of $10) options. You take the cash immediately and give up your right to receive any more of the $2/share premium. Since your risk is now less than zero dollars (your exercise price is less than your stock price), you are said to be writing, that is, you are creating new options. If the option you held had any intrinsic value you would lose, or at a minimum give up the possibility of receiving that gain. So you give up $0.50/share for the right to write this option. You gain and lose both cash and intrinsic value, while netting exactly zero dollars.","Your question seems to indicate that you have some uncertainty about the following:  In a nutshell, if I had $500k to invest in the ""stock market"" I might buy a ""basket"" of stock of a couple dozen or so companies.  I may own 1,000 shares of stock for Apple, 1,000 shares of stock for Google, 1,000 shares of stock for JPMorgan, 1,000 shares for Coca Cola, etc. -- 25 or so of them.  That way, I could profit, if any one company had a great year, or if 6 of the 25 had a great year, etc. But my ""reward"" for this investment would be twofold: I can lose money in this investment.  If ""Apple"" had a bad year I might end up with 800 shares and lose all the money I'd invested in ""Apple"" while the other 24 companies did fine.  I might end up with 500 shares in JP Morgan and only 500 shares in Coca Cola, losing money in my investment in Coca Cola.    The second reward for this investment option is that the stock market goes up.  Not that all of those companies did better, but that in general the market goes up, so we all profit.  If all those companies had an ""even"" year, all performed pretty much the same as they'd performed the year before -- this year is not going to be better -- but you still profit.  The stock market has gone up, so you have more money invested in those same stocks that you started out with.  This gives a ""guarantee"" to the ""investment"" of the ""stock market"" that ""it will go up in value"".  (This guarantee does not appear to be very good right now.) You can, on the other hand, ""invest"" in what's known as an ""inverse fund"".  These funds invest in companies that are doing poorly, i.e. whose stocks have gone down, or will go down. As you can see, investing in the stock market may pay off for you, but doesn't pay off for the company whose stock you are buying.  Why?  Because when you buy, the price goes up (assuming other people are also buying), meaning the company makes money off you, you make money off the upswing.  So, if I had $500k and I wanted to invest it in the stock market, would I invest in one of these inverse funds? Or if I were an individual stock holder, and wanted to sell a few of my shares, would I sell them to an ""inverse fund""?  No.  The stock market has rewards for the sellers as well as for investors.  Thus, many people hold on to their shares as long as they possibly can. But if a company's stock goes down, but ""they are not doing anything about it"", then some people may wish to get some money for them.  Thus, if you create an ""inverse fund"" that invests in companies whose stocks are going down, those companies may start to go out of business by selling their shares at whatever price the share will command.  This may not be a good thing. Hence the question: Is investing in an ""inverse fund"" or investing in an ""investment"" in the stock market the same as investing in the companies you're investing in?  Not necessarily. Thus, you can see some risks involved.  The risk of your shares going up because of the stock market going up.  The risk of your shares going down because the stock market is going down.  And if the stock market is not moving, the risks of the company you're investing in going up or down. You might also wish to look up how people choose to invest the money in their 401(k) plans. Some are quite risky and can do very well. Some lose money.  Some are fairly conservative and might lose very little money one year, but get back their money the next year. Your question seems to indicate that you are interested in what will give you the most money, what the ""guaranteed"" investment is and what the ""riskier"" investment is.  But these are all relative: When you buy your first home, you may look for a mortgage.  You look at the ""guaranteed"" interest rate you can get, which you'll pay forever!  But what about your monthly money?  When you choose a 30 year loan, you can either pay $1,0"
[INST] Negative properties of continuously compounded returns [/INST],"Here's my take on it, there are many interpretations: (I also see there is a bit of controversy about compound interest - see this Q&A for more on it) When compound interest is stated it has a context, and the context is growth. Growth is the increase in quantity or the expansion, in size of the population as a result of births, immigration, or other causes, usually expressed as an exponential function.   Lets say that you have 1000 shares on Dec 31st 2014, and that the annual compounded growth rate is X%, by Dec 31st 2015, assuming the stock price hasn't changed at all through that period - the value the next year should be 1000*(1+X) shares, assuming that they are held in a tax advantaged account. If the stock price falls to 900 in 2015, and so the value at 2016 year-end will be at 810, or if you look at it another way, the price could be 900 but the percentage of growth is now 10% and the final value is 990. It's easy to see that this is just another way of saying that you're adding an extra percent to your share base every year. The growth rate in that case has also changed to 1.00009 or 9.99%  In your original question you mention 3% as the rate, but it's quite meaningless out of context unless you also say how much money you need in the long term / what you're trying to do. Assuming we only care about growth in this Q&A, you could just call it the Y% interest rate, and Y% would be the growth rate.  So, when you say that a negative Y can't really exist without violating the laws of nature, you are correct. When you talk about the stock market, you have to remember that it's also a market for trading securities - shares in companies.  The share price could be driven down, but if the growth rate is still above the cash interest rate, it would still be growing in value and be a suitable vehicle in a long term portfolio. From an owner of a business perspective - if you can convince all of your employees to accept pay rises of 2%, but the growth rate of the business is 4%, then over time you would be earning more than your employees and you would have enough funds to employ more workers, increasing the size of the business. But, if you cut the wages by 2% and the business was stuck at 3.9% growth, in the long term you won't be able to pay your employees and you'll find it hard to recruit new workers who demand a pay rise above 3.9%, the more you increase the rate the better.  (there are other factors, but this is not a discussion of business management for this Q&A) That doesn't mean that a certain share price will be constant - it might go up and down, if a good number of shareholders decide to sell, the stock price will go down, and even if it climbs up a few times, it's also quite possible that the growth rate will slowly fall, so that it is still below the cash interest rate.","There's no such thing as negative rate of return. And rate of return is not the same as dividends - it's much broader, and takes into account changes in the capital invested. If there would be such a thing as negative return, that would mean you invested your money and the value decreased. And there would always be a risk/investment policy that delivers a negative return. For example, the policy can be to buy on the open price and sell on the closing one. There would always be stocks that open at prices higher than the value. So this is the example of investment where every time you invest your money - your capital is getting smaller. This is called loss, not negative rate of return. For continuous compounding, you need something continuous, which means that there's no time at which it was different from what it is now. So this is not dividends because dividends are paid at certain times. Return is continuous in the sense of that it's the capital that increases or decreases, and it's not time-specific."
[INST] At what point is it most advantageous to cease depositing into a 401k? [/INST],"If I could retire in 17 years, should I   start contributing to my IRA now?  Yes, of course.  If you want to retire then, you can.  That means, 401k's might be more the thing for some of your pay.   If you want to max your IRA's, you must make your 17Y plan. If so, then you know how many years until you can stop, and what your income from retirement will be.  If you are contributing every year, the number of years you can then wait to start paying can diminish, especially if you choose to leave more behind than you take.   If I want to spend less now, then contribute more now.  Is it a good   idea to delay my retirement? If by 'spend less' you mean 'contribute less', it is not a good idea to do that.  You have a plan for retirement.  The IRA is retirement also.  If you think contributing now will be less, you may have a misunderstanding.   The best way to retire is to live on a budget.  You should have some, 'do not touch' reserves of money for retirement that you don't dip into no matter what. There is no sense in retiring if you can't live on your budget, which usually is a fraction of your income when you start.  If that budget will sustain you, you can retire.   So, if I want to retire now, then contribute less   to my IRA?  Should I contribute more to my current 401k? Or, your question should read, ""If, I want to retire in 17 years, should I contribute more to my IRA?""","It is always good to do the research.  The short answer is that for the most part you want to contribute up to the match on your 401k.  Even the minimum of say 3% will produce income tax savings.  Depending on your age and where you put the money, that money growing in the 401k will be tax deferred giving additional tax savings.  The one thing you need to do here is make sure you do the math.  You can put yourself in a pickle if you contribute too much and then need the money in a lump sum for an emergency.  This is where the 401k loan back down the road will come into play. For retirement planning (and this is something we don't see often enough as advisors) you need to know how much you'll need for retirement and how long you'll live.  Then you'll know what rate of return you need to target plus the risk associated etc.  If you do your research and know how much you need, then the rest is really easy."
"[INST] If the co-signer on my car loan dies, can the family take the car from me like they're threatening to? [/INST]","This is one of those tricky questions that can only be truly answered with a case-by-case basis.  The biggest complications come from the family, the dealership and the state you live in as well as the specific terms within the loan. Assuming that the debt will be satisfied/repaidered within the life of your brother's estate. I am not an attorney and do not give legal advice, and this is not an exhaustive list of issues that could arise, but I will give you some basic questions to ask to determine if you have any issues based on your situation. Assuming you have already spoken with a legal adviser to make sure that there are no issues on a state level, here are some questions you may want to ask: I realize that these questions seem vague and that they could apply to any family heirloom, but I think it is best to get a feel for any potential issues while things are still relatively simple.","You know what you should do? Give the car back to the bank and get another loan.  There isn't a law against getting rid of co-owner in a transaction, because there is no co-ownership. Your mom is an ""agent"" of the bank, she is not an owner.  You will pay the penalties for not paying in court, but there are legal protections to co-signers.  In most cases the bank will try and pursue your mom for the loan."
[INST] Automatic transaction on credit card to stay active [/INST],"If you plan to carry your accounts open indefinitely for the credit rating it really isn't a big deal. You should pay off the total balance each month anyway so the interest isn't a factor, and you shouldn't be hit with an annual fee. The automatic charge is usually more hassle than it's worth, and usually you pay more in late fees and interest than if you had just let the card go dormant (assuming you paid everything up front). On the other hand, if you plan to go into debt that charge may add more temptation, and in that case it wouldn't be a good idea to add more temptation rather than removing it. You also need to consider the annual fee, and be sure the value from the credit card is worth the yearly fee (if there is no annual fee, by all means keep the card open).","The credit card issuer does not care whether you purchase an item or not, they get paid for the credit card fees every time you make a transaction.  Also there's something that's called the merchant processing fee, which is about 4% to 6% of every transaction.  For $10 items, that could be $0.40.  In addition, there's a per transaction fee for the merchant, usually about $0.15.  For 10 transactions per month, that's $0.15.  There may also be additional costs to the merchant if there are extra manual transactions or if the card is declined or if the card is suspended.  All of these things are money out of the merchant's pocket.  They are also money that the merchant does not make on that transaction.  They're not going to eat the extra merchant fees just for you; that's where you get your $10.95 fee.  In addition, a lot of credit card issuers put limits on how much you can charge on a card to remain active.  For example I've seen it set at about $3000.  So if I've charged $2999, I would get an automatic transaction to $3000.  This is to say that a lot of credit card issuers will force you to purchase something rather than just make a transaction fee for a retailer. The fact that if you spend this much, they'll waive the fee (which is why I put the fee at $30,000 and not closer to the $300 to $600 limit) is just a way of getting you to hit the other limit and then be tempted to not make additional small transactions.  In other words, credit card companies like to get more money out of you at every chance they get, and if they can entice you into purchasing something rather than just giving you a $30 credit, they'll do it. The fact that your card isn't charged as a debit card means nothing.  It'll still count as a small purchase, unless, as JoeTaxpayer said, there are other limitations. If you really don't want to get a Visa gift card, my suggestion would be to try to find a regular merchant that will give them a $30 credit.
For what it's worth, American Express calls it an automatic payment fee.  And like with your credit card, it looks like the merchant pays the fee; so $30 is probably the limit.  Chase Visa says the merchant pays the fee, and again the minimum is $30, but then they also mention that it's $250 if the merchant uses the PayFlex Automated Payment System.  If you do use the PayFlex Automated Payment System, in some other states it says a convenience fee may be assessed in some markets and will be the responsibility of the merchant.  So $5 could be an additional fee for you to consider.  But regardless, all they're trying to do is get you to make that minimum purchase.  (Credit Union One calls it a convenience fee, so I think it's safe to say it's the same everywhere.)"
"[INST] If throwing good money after bad is generally a bad idea, is throwing more money after good Ok? [/INST]","This is just an extreme example of opportunity cost. Suppose I spent $100 on something which I no longer want, but it is in perfectly good condition, and a friend offered me $90 for it. If I sell the item now, would I have more to spend and would I be happier to spend it, or would this make me less happy somehow? If I sell it tomorrow for a further $10, and could then sell it again a week later for an 11th, then wouldn't that be better? Or have I only put off the inevitable, while feeling happy now! In your own time line is it better to act now or to wait? The opportunity is 'lost' if you don't act immediately because by definition you cannot act immediately, but you will get more by acting tomorrow because it will be tomorrow and so the future will have more in it. And so on.. but at what cost? Is this just a way to put off the inevitable, rather than facing up to the fact that the original outlay was a big mistake.","Suppose you've invested $100K in the stock market, and some random stocks you picked have gone down by 40%, and you add another $100K of investments. In this case you have added a net $50K and have a net loss of $50K -50K = -$100K. You may end up going farther on the negative side, but you would then have a larger net position, of course. Or is this a flawed way to think about it? Why not? Of course it's not! But it is only valuable when comparing to alternatives. If the best/cheapest way to recoup the losses is to add more investments, then certainly do not hesitate. But you need to consider all the other alternatives as well."

[INST] Is is possible to dispute IRS underpayment penalties? [/INST],"The IRS will not waive failure to file or failure to pay penalties.  These penalties are the penalty for not having filed your tax return in a timely fashion. Also, note that you must pay your interest on top of the failure to pay penalty as well. If this tax return represents all your income during the calendar year 2008, you will need to file your tax return 60+ days late, for the IRS to waive the failure to pay penalty. If not, for tax year 2008 your late filing is waived, you just pay the failure to pay penalty of the late filing penalty and the interest which is likely to have been higher.  See Publication 459, Exemption From Late Filing Penalty. If there is a good faith reason not to have filed timely, you're out of luck.  The only other reason your penalty will be waived is for an Administrative Error by the IRS. If this is what's happened, and you've filed all your returns timely before the due date, you're ok and you shouldn't have a late penalty or a late filing penalty, let alone an under payment penalty.  See Publication 459 for other instances where the IRS is forgiving, but you have to act. You may be eligible to make a Qualitied Offer in Compromise if 1040-ES underpayment was done accidentally and you now have all the dollars to pay. These are the reasons where you think the IRS should waive all penalties.  It's unlikely that you'd qualify.  See Publications 1791, 529, and 647, Form 656. In this case, I suspect that you had the money in your account but failed to write an appropriately placed check, or had the check at the appropriate place, but didn't have enough in your account to cover it.  Both are considered under payment penalties, even if you had the money in your account. You should not be surprised by this.  This is a penalty for not paying your taxes timely.  If you want to avoid paying this penalty again, then do something else.","Yes. You're free to fight.  But, fight hard. You will need facts and evidence to support your argument. IRS Specialty Support Unit will do their best to win the penalties. They will use their tools to establish that you were negligent or reckless when not filing. These will include 1) How long have you filed, and how regular were your filings? 2) How many times did you report a loss in taxes by overestimating your income?  3) How were you managing your affairs?  If you were handling it yourself? Were you using a CPA/EA/Tax Attorney? 4) Did you seek a CPA/EA/Tax Attorney to reduce your taxes? 5) What were the errors in your filed tax return? Were they small errors or a major gap in your income?  6) Were you aware of the tax law requirements for this entity vs an LLC? What did you do to correct that?

[INST] I have about 20 000 usd. How can invest them to do good in the world? [/INST],"There are quite a few sites that help you find an investing vehicle that aligns with your beliefs. The most well known, in my experience, is faithinvesting.org. They provide a listing of many mutual funds, and their alignment with your beliefs. However, most investing is not as ""clean"" as a mutual fund; your money is used to finance many different companies. Here is another good resource on the subject.","Some nonfinancial resources: There are dozens of different socially and environmentally responsible investing firms. Some choose companies who have high ratings of how they operate or what their mission or goals within their industries. Some only choose 'green' companies or ones with the best human rights records.  There are also 'screened' funds and shares as well. These firms usually have a policy of divesting shares in particular industries or companies they do not agree with. For the U.S. this can include those involved in tobacco, alcohol, pornography, etc. Some include all of the above in their policy.  Socially responsible investing firms include: If anyone has suggestions for a particular firm let me know in comments and I will add them here."
[INST] How to properly report income without 1099-MISC [/INST],"It's not at all certain to me that a 3rd party payer is required to report your income to the IRS if/when they've paid you.  To what extent is it their problem?  They've already sent the money as far as they are concerned.  Perhaps they keep records of the payments, perhaps not.  What's it to them? They may actually not know they're paying you an income (and maybe that doesn't matter, who is going to ask?)  They may think they're only paying you a fee - just like for a lawyer or a repair man. Or maybe the IRS and/or the courts would be so happy to make it a crime to not report payments that some accountants simply say ""always declare those payments"".  But I'm not sure it's the law, and I think it's a good idea to look into it if possible to determine once and for all.  Of course, maybe a law suit will come up and we'll find out.  :-)  In the meantime, though, I think you should keep track of each of those jobs (or maybe just lump 'em all together and just keep one record for the whole gig) and then decide to treat it whatever way makes your life easier.  In this business there seems to only be two ""things that make your life difficult"" -- not keeping good records and not paying taxes.  It's worth noting again that if you make $7.50/hr babysitting, you will still owe more taxes on that than the person who makes $88.21/yr.  The difference in rate and the difference between ""income"" and ""payroll tax"" vs self-employment tax are really, really subtle.  So if something happens in the future that you need these records, you won't suddenly be in the position of being unable to provide them and/or being unable to convince the IRS that this and this and this weren't your income but were actually expenditures.  And remember, it's not necessarily just the IRS you may need to convince some day, it may also be a client, a future employer, the court system during an accounting or criminal trial, the USCIS or TSA or FBI or NCIS or ATF or CBP or the US Coast Guard, an investigative reporter or an unfriendly neighbor or a foreign power.  If they ask about that income from six years ago, you need to be able to provide a decent answer.  So keep excellent records and be a good little citizen.","If it is true income and is not paid to you for services rendered (ie: commission on the referral) then it is unearned income and the business that paid it should send you a 1099-MISC form regardless of the income amount. And yes, you have to report it even if no 1099 is sent to you. If you received an item for free, no matter what the price, in return for posting about a product/service and did not provide any other service in return - it might not be taxable and if so the business is not required to report it as income on 1099-MISC. Consult with your tax adviser."

You join, and if you use it, then you can get a discount off retail prices, however if you don't the club is just loosing you as a member, and will not extend it's privileges to you.

[INST] Claiming income/deductions on an illegal apartment [/INST],"In the U.S., rental income is taxable, regardless of whether you can legally do it or not. However, expenses are deductible only to the extent of the income. If you can't legally rent your place, though, you aren't earning income, so you aren't entitled to deduct the associated expenses. Furthermore, the government may be entitled to a portion of any payments that you do receive, if they can find out about them.","Whether or not it is illegal is not the factor in how to report it, it is up to you. I would just leave it as income until the building code enforcement does there job. When they come to condemn it, I would sell it to them for half or no price. Then you will have a write off. I know people who have done it and sold it for pennies but it still got rid of it. Or you can just burn it down after you get everything you need from it. Just check your lease to make sure you are not breaking an agreement. The lease will stipulate that any alterations to the apartment must be approved by the owner, and the approval must be in writing. Some landlords will only allow alterations to make it aesthetically pleasing not functional.  You should have asked your landlord before you embarked on your home improvement projects."
[INST] How profitable is selling your customer base? [/INST],"That is actually a very rare situation if you've got 100% market share or thereabouts. Notably, eBay bought PayPal a while back for roughly $11 billion, but paid for it largely using its own shares (which were diluted in order to pay for it). The transaction was so complex that it took nearly a year to settle; it involved transferring eBay's market share in PayPal to a new subsidiary in Luxemburg, and then the Luxemburg subsidiary issuing shares which were then exchanged for eBay shares. It meant that PayPal and eBay retained 40% share each in the deal. (eBay's stock went through a rollercoaster as a result of the deal, although this was due to other factors related to its own internal strategy as opposed to PayPal's value.) The company (PayPal) itself was also publicly traded, and as the second largest ecommerce company in the world, I would suspect the market value today (which is $89bn, or roughly 7x annualised revenues) is much less dependent on its eBay partnerships and more in tune with its current growth potential, which includes online and mobile commerce. As a side note, if you look at Yahoo's history, they made roughly $3-5bn from the sale of Yahoo Japan and Yahoo Alibaba, respectively. Yahoo Japan made up a large chunk of their profits in 2006, whereas Yahoo Alibaba wasn't as big, but still. eBay/PayPal are also examples of the classic ""Baumol Effect"" where a growing company can grow faster and faster when it comes to acquisition/sale of companies. I highly suggest reading this article, it's a bit dated but still holds up today.","There are plenty of scenarios where selling your customer base directly to someone else will be more profitable than simply selling the assets related to the data (domain names, servers, etc.) While I appreciate your desire to make the most lucrative sale, I think you underestimate how common it is for site owners to sell their customers in these scenarios; to me, it sounds more common than selling domain names or hosting deals. One thing that you have to consider, as a starting point, is how much it costs to acquire your current customer base. If selling the customer base results in a loss of data/intellectual property (the underlying information behind the data) that makes this acquisition more expensive than expected, then the entire idea of selling the customer base may fall apart. The buyer only wants the names and contact information, and any additional data they aren't going to pay you for. (Anyone would consider ""any additional data"" to be all the data, right?) Another scenario is that you are planning to expand or alter your business based on your current customer base's needs and/or their feedback, making it essential to retain the data. If you are in the information business (such as if you are a market researcher), then selling your customers is likely to eliminate your business in a sense and be a terrible deal for you (and probably your customers). One other scenario is that your current customer's data can be monetized in the context of the customer base (and possibly more so for related information). For example, if you own a small software business then selling the ""intellectual property"" you have invested in developing the programs may not be as important as selling a lot of software units to the customers. If the data is very specific to one context, then you have few other places to sell it. The example that brought the issue of selling a customer base to mind for me was when I bought a software license off a Canadian website; the software came with a 3-year warranty. The software vendor sold the warranty period and warranty information (along with other information) to another company while I was using the program. While I had to contact the new warranty vendor (which is what I wanted to do in the first place), this company contacted all my associates. I don't recommend this practice, personally, because it may violate anti-spam laws if you have any legal or personal contractual agreements with your customers, and the customers don't want some third party trying to sell them something."
"[INST] In 2015, why has the price of natural gas been plummeting? [/INST]","Demand remains slack: There is plenty of natural gas available to meet consumer needs, and the energy markets have been oversupplied for several years.  In the last couple of years, demand for gas (particularly gas from Texas) has waned, and some producers have ceased production.  Natural gas demand has been relatively flat for the last couple of years: the U.S. Energy Information Administration's annual outlook for 2015 estimates production to decrease 0.3%, and consumption (for the whole of 2014, not just the last few months) to decrease 0.8%). Explanations of the recent price drop: Weather has been warmer than the previous two winters, causing many consumers to use less gas to heat their homes during the winter.  As a direct result, consumption has been lower than expected in the last few months.  Prices, which usually drop when demand goes down but are kept high by storage constraints, remained high until this year because of increased (and, ironically, ""warmer"") global trade.  Increased gas trade with Mexico and with Europe (where prices are high) have, until now, prevented prices from dropping sharply.  The mild weather in the U.S. has caused demand to drop, leading to increased price differentiation among regions in the U.S.  Prices in the East are higher than they are in the Gulf Coast -- and therefore cheaper than Europe (and Mexico) can get gas from the U.S.  As a result, U.S. gas trade with Mexico and Europe has dropped.  Global trade hasn't been much of a factor recently.  Prices dropped quickly in April 2015 because U.S. production did not pick up as quickly as expected. Prices are also down because of decreased production of natural gas from oil and gas fields.  According to a recent article, oil and gas production is down 7% (as of late 2014), and a good deal of that production is from Texas, where prices have been depressed the most.  As a result, some producers have shut down fields that were producing marginal margins of profit -- and decreasing global gas trade has allowed prices to dip down even lower.","There have been three factors leading to the plummeting price: production, demand and weather.  The production of natural gas has been rising in the past 19 years, with large increases starting in 2007.  This increase was driven in turn by shale gas.  At the same time, natural gas demand rose, particularly in the industrial sector which increased production.  The rising demand and production both contribute to increased supply, decreasing the value of the resource.  In terms of demand, there were two large, separate demand spikes.  The first was in 2002-2006 as increased energy prices caused residential natural gas and electricity demand to shift to natural gas.  The next was from 2009-2010 when the industrial sector shifted their processes toward natural gas, which caused demand to increase over the next two years.  Lastly, the past two winters have been particularly cold, which pushed demand for natural gas, and increased the use of coal-fired plants which use natural gas.  There are now surpluses of natural gas stockpiled, particularly along the West coast of the United States.  The result of these three drivers is that demand is high and increasing, and the supply is high and increasing as well, leading naturally to reduced prices.  However, there are some reasons that the market may reverse this trend in the intermediate term; natural gas usage has been shifted significantly from industrial to residential, which is not generally a permanent shift.  Natural gas supplies could decrease more quickly than forecasted, if oil prices rise enough that shale gas reserves will become less profitable."
[INST] How can I save money on a gym / fitness membership? New Year's Resolution is to get in shape - but on the cheap! [/INST],"Get gym membership through an employer.  If you have a FSA (Flexible Spending Account) and you can buy it through there, even better. My monthly membership is around $22.","Why not see how many offers are out there?   If no-one is willing to pay a joining fee or membership fee, or they can beat other current offers, then go for it! Many of them will have terms and conditions to say that no more than x memberships can come from any one institution.  This won't apply to individuals, just businesses.  So if you're a group of people, you can get a massive discount!   If you'd still rather not shop around and get lots of offers, you could always try asking around in forums and on personal finance sites to compare offers and get a better feel for what kind of percentage discounts you should be aiming for based on previous experiences.  I hope this helps!  But above all, have fun and stay healthy!"
[INST] Comparing/reviewing personal health insurance plans for the self-employed [/INST],"It doesn't hurt to talk to someone and explain the situation and ask about their plans that might be a better fit.  You might want to look into purchasing a short term medical policy until the Affordable care act takes affect in 2014, although not sure if you can purchase one now, but you can definitely research the options.  There's also something called an HSA which could be a better fit if you're healthy and don't incur many medical costs.","The best way of comparing plans is by the monthly premium, whether you're employed or self-employed. You can use tools such as http://www.healthcarehelp.com/ to estimate the monthly costs; note that the amount you'll pay monthly could be reduced by a tax deduction. Of course, you need to understand that monthly premiums are an incomplete measure.  There are different ways of comparing the performance and benefits of insurers, among them quality-adjusted life years, discounted cash flows, actuarial value, and others.  There is a lot of information on that.  However, monthly premiums have a simple advantage:  you can easily know what you'll be paying for coverage.  Of course, it's also important to look at the deductibles, copayments, and so forth, but that's only important as long as you're healthy; if you're sick, you might as well get the coverage. Now, when you have health insurance, it's like a lottery.  You might die young, and that's going to be bad.  The thing is, most people are going to be lucky and live a long life.  So you have to decide whether you'd rather pay more each month, or risk the insurance companies getting rich off your monthly payments.  Either way, many health care experts agree you'll be better off buying insurance, so long as what you buy covers at least the expenses that Medicare would pay.  Even most medical experts think that you're much better off financially if you just buy coverage.  Your only reason to skip insurance is that your monthly expenses are more important to you than your survival, and you're making a bet you'll survive.  On that, I can't offer advice. The Affordable Care Act also has some provisions that people should understand if they plan to buy from the major insurers. If you plan on shopping from the major insurers, know that in many cases they won't cover services that may not be required until you are 70 years old or older (which makes sense because you've probably paid tens of thousands of monthly premiums by then to save enough to help you in that situation). The bottom line is that you should not have to worry about such policies because the insurance provider should have such concerns about people they have paid for decades as they have for people they haven't spent any time with.  The ACA changed that in favor of the people who are not being well taken care of."
[INST] How much time would I have to spend trading to turn a profit? [/INST],"The short answer is that it is possible but not likely. If you look at the 20 worst performers of the Dow Jones Industrials over the past 10 years, you might think that you could just short these companies and cash in on the fact that their price is going down. Well actually you might actually have cashed in at an 87% loss on these 20 stocks. So not only might the price go down, your profit could be small and negative. There is no easy formula for success in short selling. If you are a short seller, you may be better off just placing your money in a savings account and waiting. If your strategy works it will likely be extremely difficult for you to put together enough trades to earn enough money to pay the bills and buy groceries for the next year. It will be possible but not likely.","I'm going to answer this question by using trading to invest in real estate to give you the answer.  While I love real estate investing, this example is going to be used to help answer the trading question, because real estate investing is actually quite analogous to trading. Here we go... How much time would I have to spend buying and selling real estate to turn a profit? The answer is as little or as much time as you want. I can have my real estate agent buy and sell my buildings while I sit on a beach. However, what you get for less time, is less profit. How much time do I want to put into trading, and still make it profitable?  This answer is more tricky. The longer you play, the more successful you become.  In real estate, you make your first purchases and you become more educated as to what you should be looking for and how you should evaluate purchases. This makes the time you spend looking for a purchase more targeted and effective. How much time should I spend doing this?  That's a tougher question... If you are more successful than you might make it appear, you could become one of a few elite stock traders and turn quite a profit (see Deepak Pai - 10 Years Straight, Michael Zimmerman, etc.).  What you get from these folks, is they traded for many years before they developed their method and began making enough money to put into other trades. At this point, many of these folks stop trading themselves (it becomes a chore) and hand off their methods and systems to professional traders...  However, if you develop your systems with your own capital and can make $1M+ each year (like Pai), why quit? Also, most of this time is spent in research, not trading.  It is a lot easier to develop a new trading system from home on your computer than it is to run to stores for research or buy the latest home.  Your time becomes available to you, not taken from you.  The trade of gives and take is replaced by the idea of ""taking and taking"".  The only person that gives is you (at least until you retire and sell your system to someone). So, to answer your original question about how much time... If you have a lot of capital, you can give up a lot of time and spend on what you really enjoy (not trading) and still profit wildly.  Otherwise, you will have to be at your computer a lot. The final point is a good book, (and good education in general) can be invaluable when it comes to investing in real estate or markets.  If you are more successful, you will be able to afford the books.  Once you have done the hard work of becoming successful, you will also have the time to read up on the markets and become even more successful. The first step can be difficult, and it will take some time, but eventually you will become more successful and have your system to take much of the time out of the equation.  Once you've made that step, why would you want to take any more time off?  This time is your reward."
[INST] Taxes on selling stock [/INST],"In addition to taxes due at the time of the sale (based on your cost basis for the shares, which includes any commissions), you are also likely to have 30% of your profits withheld for US taxes by the broker/intermediary or their clearing agent. However, you are most likely entitled to a Refund from the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of up to 30% of the tax withheld (in case you were wondering where the money went, don't bother, the IRS is not required to track that, and they aren't likely to bother trying), in the form of a credit against your tax liability for the year. There could conceivably be some state income tax to be added on to the Federal income tax (the 30% figure is for Federal income tax only, and applies regardless of whether the transaction was short-term or long-term) - in which case there would be a further withholding amount applied to the amount of your State income tax refund. However, I was never able to find the regulations on how much the broker must, in addition to the estimated federal tax, withhold for state-level taxes. The IRS, however, does offer one document regarding Foreign Bank and Financial Account (FBAR) disclosure due by citizens or resident aliens having interests in foreign financial accounts or assets of over $10,000 on June 30 of each year. There are penalties for not sending in a correct FBAR if the transaction went through a foreign entity. Additionally, it appears that foreign investments are subject to further withholding and/or reporting requirements as set out in this document, as well as in the FATCA - FBAR requirements in this context (FATCA stands for Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which appears to be separate from the FBAR). Regarding how this affects you, in the case of a foreign transaction (purchase, sale, or transfer), if the FBAR filing is late, then you would be assessed a penalty of $10,000, or 50% of the account balance (whichever is greater), for each failure; and the failure is deemed to be for each month or partial month during which you were required to file the FBAR and it was not timely filed. In addition to the FATCA foreign accounts and assets tax reporting, FFAR regulations apply. There are other requirements, also set out in that document, including ""Reporting of Foreign Gifts"". There is also the form 8938: Statement of Foreign Financial Assets. I suspect it's possible that foreign transfers via intermediaries (i.e. your sale involved the purchase by someone other than a broker or bank, and the ownership of the shares has been changed, but not yet registered in the new owner's ownership record) might require further withholding/taxation/reporting. See the form 1042 Instruction for further information regarding US Withholding tax on dispositions of U.S. securities owned by foreign corporations, and the associated notice: Notice 2013-37 (see the section entitled For Foreign Seller for more information and link), and related documents and forms. The notice is in its own right confusing as to who is responsible for reporting to the IRS, and may depend on the type of account holding the shares. I have heard of some brokers (i.e. the company/entity handling purchase and/or sale of the shares between the owner and the new owner) not paying the tax - instead requiring buyers/transferees to do so (which they do - otherwise how did they get your money?). I suspect some brokers (again, a broker is just the broker, not the entity being transferred to...) might require you to fill out a form. Some require you to enter some information when you purchase the shares - for instance, information regarding citizenship status (whether you're a US citizen or an alien, or simply an entity). The entity in question (which could be a broker/bank/bond trader/etc. selling you the shares, or it could be another entity to whom the shares are being sold) might be responsible for sending in form 3520 (and other forms?) to the IRS - see: Publication 1320 for more information.","When you say realized capital gains, it means the profits you realize when you sell stock. Unrealized capital gains are profits you realized when you sell the stock, but you haven't liquidated yet. For Long-Term Capital Gains you must have held the stock for at least a year before buying; for Short-Term Capital Gains, you must have held the stock for less than a year.  Both of these are considered gains as you sell the stock. If they occur in 2013 they are not subject to the income tax you are paying in the same year, but next year. So, at the end of the year when you file taxes, you include the gains for Long-term Capital Gains and Short-term Capital Gains. You are taxed at regular income tax rates for Long-term capital gains and at your marginal tax rate for short-term capital gains but the following year. Keep in mind that you pay the taxes only after the gains are realized. So, if you sell the stock and they're realized, but then the stock loses value, you will not be taxed on those profits. Also, if you sold the stock in a losing position, and that position recovers, you will be required to pay taxes on those gains that you did realize, including the ones at the gain or loss as you sell. This is because you are allowed to make a profit when you sell the stock. Therefore the amount you are taxed comes with the following conditions: You pay the higher tax rate if you have a low income, and a lower tax rate if you have a high income. The government tries to penalize those who are wealthy."
[INST] Indie Software Developers - How do I handle taxes? [/INST],"You need to file a 1040 personal income tax form, and schedule C with the IRS.  From your post, you have already figured out the expenses part, you just need to know that if you use an accounting program, they can help you print the appropriate forms to fill out and send in. You should always get a receipt for your credit card transactions to file away with your receipts or store statement. As far as estimating how much for taxes, you will be paying roughly 1/4 of your income as taxes if you're by yourself.  This is a rough estimate since the IRS allows you to have 2 personal exemptions, which makes them not tax as much of your income.  It is a good deal of money though, so set aside 20% of your monthly income just in case.  From your post, if you make 10k a year, then 2000 will go to taxes. If you are doing this as a part time thing with a day job, you have to pay self-employment taxes (Social Security & Medicare taxes) on your income, which comes in at 10.3%(2004 numbers, 2005 numbers). Your expenses are subtracted from the income. You may also have to do estimated taxes (quarterly) while you are doing the business. You can figure out your estimated tax amount by using the worksheet in IRS pub17: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/wp17.pdf  This will help you figure out how much money you would owe the IRS if you had to pay them as taxes at the end of the year. For example, if you made 10k and you received $6k worth of income, then you were paid (withheld) for $8k in income tax already, you only have to pay $2k as an estimate.  Again, see the instructions for IRS pub17 if you are confused here.  It will all be explained.","As a self-employed individual doing contract work - you qualify as a sole proprietorship for the purposes of filing a personal yearly tax return. While there are several forms I would recommend using Form 8829 (Profits or Losses from Business) Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business) and Schedule SE (Self Employment Tax).  Each will be needed in order to calculate the income that you would like to declare. Form 1040 is your basic yearly tax return form and is used to declare income and deductions across the year. Each form will contain useful explanations and guidance that pertain to your earnings if you need help understanding what to enter. If you're looking for specific tax software such as Turbotax or H&R Block it's best to consult a professional who can help you fill out the forms. The filing deadline is April 15th but if you have to pay additional tax as a result of incorrectly completed tax return then your filing deadline will be October 15th.

[INST] What is the preferred way to finance home improvements when preparing to sell your house? [/INST],"If your goal is to increase the value of your house so you can sell it and make money, then the best way is to use a Home Equity Line of Credit. Otherwise, I would use ""Cash-Out Refinance"" in order to avoid high closing costs on a HELOC. If your goal is to improve equity or the house, in order to live there for a long time, my answer will be similar to the one on the other question, but instead of taking a loan, I would suggest looking into taking out a home equity line, also known as HELOC. You can't take the loan out of the  equity that it creates! If you take out a 20 year mortgage, you are taking 20 years to pay down the equity in your home, but  you're taking the value that should have increased by the increase in interest in that amount of time too.  For most people, this is a great way to get cash for a variety of needs, from debt consolidation to paying medical expenses. This is because you are taking your equity, and then you don't pay any money for 10 years, and then interest only for the next 10 years. The HELOC that we have is an interest only product for the first 10 years, and then you need to pay ""payments"" every month, but those payments include principle, so you pay down your borrowing. In our case it was a 15 year amortization at roughly 3.5 to 4% interest (the interest is deductible in most cases). And then you have a 10 year balloon. If you sell it, you can pay it off, sell it before the end of 20 years, and pay off the balloon. If you have a good enough job and a low enough debt to income ratio, you can usually get better rates (lower APR and interest) than credit cards, usually 2-3%. So in our case, for 15 years, we probably paid less than 2.5% interest total, and that was after the rate increase in 2018.","It isn't the money at issue here, but the timing. In the end, the goal is to make your house sell. The first step to do that is to maximize your net profit from the house. Your second step is to maximize the time it spends on the market. Now, if you spend a lot of money on improvements, you do two things: The net effect of doing this is you increase your income, but you also decrease your liquid assets. If you reduce your liquid assets, you may end up spending a lot of additional money on financing the improvements. This is money that is not adding to the value of the house, so you are just paying a lot of money for that benefit. If you cannot get the loan on good terms, you may not want to do it. Your next home will also be ""improved,"" and you will have an even greater drain on your liquid assets to afford that house.  In the end, it is probably better to take out a loan during this process. I don't know why you insist on paying yourself first, but that is generally not advisable. There are some times I would do this, but taking out a loan on a home improvement project is not one of those times."
[INST] Does buying and selling a stock OR holding onto it make a company look better? [/INST],"When you buy a share of a company's stock, that money is sent to the company. When you sell a share of a company's stock, that money is paid to you, who owns the share, by the buyer. So in the case where you buy it in your own cash account, the company's worth gets increased by the market value of the share ($15), whereas, in the case of the sell, the company doesn't see money from the sale. Doesn't matter whether you sell it on the open market or through a stock dividend.","If the CEO sells an amount of shares to pay taxes or to meet some other personal need, the corporation's share price will usually fall since the amount of the CEO's sale is often a significant portion of the corporation's share volume.  It's not a good sign to see the CEO selling a large quantity of his own shares and the corporation's stock price follows it lower. It's seen as the CEO selling at the wrong time."
[INST] What are the risks of Dividend-yielding stocks? [/INST],"First and foremost - a dividend in the current accounting conventions represents a company's cash flow as a one-time event.  Unless the company has a special dividend paying schedule (like MMM), the price of the stock is not likely to immediately decrease as a result of these dividends being paid out, because the cash flow is not supposed to be a constant recurrence.   The question you need to ask yourself is really: What makes a dividend paying company a poor investment?  The answer to that is that you must evaluate the company in the context of the business - the risk level of the industry the company operates in (low risk -> better investment), and whether the company will have the cash flow necessary to be able to maintain its dividends (and possibly grow), given the future economic environment. You'd want to evaluate dividend paying stock the same as any stock - you're evaluating the future dividend yields as a part of the stock price.  So long as a company continues paying dividends, and as long as it has positive cash flows, this should be a great investment for any investor seeking capital appreciation.","Yield can be deceiving. Why are Yielding Stocks Riskier? Because in large, large part, yield is a feature of an overvalued stock. It means that dividends are higher than revenues over a particular period (traditionally, 1 year). This is usually due to a dividend being declared despite poor performance over past periods, or in periods where the company is suffering poor margins. The danger here is one of the 'when'. When companies continue to pay dividends when they perform poorly (or even at unsustainable margins for sustained periods), the share price is bid up, and the future cash flow on which one can calculate yield is discounted more - the discount is higher. So what happens when the company really starts performing poorly? The value of the shares plummet, and you are sitting holding an apple that's just about ready to fall out of the tree. Yield isn't usually a useful measure of your return, either. Most firms that pay consistent yields do so after a period of sustained and increasing returns. During this period, the dividend rises and the share price increases, so you get the double benefit of an increasing capital gain and an increasingly robust yield. Then the cycle turns, and you get the whipsaw effect of decreasing returns and decreasing income."
[INST] Safe method of paying for a Gym Membership? [/INST],"Some gyms have auto credit card payments if it helps you with budgeting.  There is often a charge for this service. So it is easier as you do not have to remember your payments, your bank has the date and all you have to is set up an automatic transfer with your payment. This was my solution in one of my former jobs.  The bank also has the advantage of putting the money straight into the gym's bank account and you don't have to go through the faff of taking a receipt, having a direct debit run by them. Just make sure you keep your receipts so you know the full amount being paid.","When dealing with monthly/recurring payments it's always best to have control over when and how much money is taken - you want to be able to stop and start payments, and to control exactly what is taken by making small payments. Online services like PayPal (or the new Google Wallet which supports pre-authorized recurring payments of a set amount) have excellent features that make recurring payments safe and easy.  Credit cards offer many more guarantees (see below), but don't allow as much control.  Another consideration is whether you actually need the money while you are waiting for refunds; the credit card will probably give you the ability to do without the money if you want to cancel the membership immediately, but to get your money back from PayPal (or money from the merchant), you may have to wait up to 60 days (this depends on which country you are in). As I mentioned before, the money taken by PayPal is not yours - it is on hold for the merchant (in your account).  They are taking it now, but they can't have it until you release it by accepting the final payment.  If you don't release any payments, they can't get any money from you, and you can just dispute any payments.  If you decide to take a few months of gym membership for free, you should be safe from any bad stuff as long as you only uncheck the box next to ""Release this payment"".  There is no contract in place, so if you don't authorize them to get your money, they cannot (legally) get your money.   If you're sure that you aren't going to ever go back to that gym, you should be able to dispute all the payments: This is PayPal's official Disputing a Recurring Payment help page, but it also covers most of the questions I would have in this position.  You can't just change your mind about paying them, but you can dispute ALL their payments and (legally) be in the right. You need to read and understand it pretty well - it's long, but I think I covered the basics.  There are a lot of PayPal scams out there because it is so simple to get your money back if you do it the right way, but it does require a little education. EDIT 2013-06-04: I see that there is some more recent discussion involving PayPal on the same topic. I should point out the fact that while all of the above information is true, and PayPal is great for doing exactly this, doing this with a credit card may be better because you have 60 days to reverse the entire payment, even if you change your mind a day or two later; while with PayPal you have to fight to get some payments, you have to fight to keep some payments while risking all future ones being lost.  The details of this make this whole process a little more complex (and more difficult if you change your mind)."
[INST] What is the “Bernanke Twist” and “Operation Twist”? What exactly does it do? [/INST],"I'm going to be brief so I can explain this in a short time frame but I think that this is the best explanation to understanding why and what the ""Operation Twist"" is. I think that what has not been explained in previous posts is ""Why"" the quantitative easing program needed to be altered?  The FED already increased the monetary base by 367% ($3.3 trillion at the start of 'Quantitative Easing 2' ). It did this because the money available for use by the private sector has gone into the banks and is not being lent out. So what we have here is a central bank that is running a zero interest policy while the private sector is in no position to take advantage of it. Another issue is that the money the FED has pumped out has not done much to boost demand on goods (such as a car) for which prices are still high. This is more of an issue now because the FED has printed more money than before and the cost of borrowing from the central bank is only available through the primary dealer system. When you look at the price of gold it is still moving up and the euro currency pair keeps on going up in price. This points to how weak the dollar really is when you measure foreign investment in gold. If the money the FED has created was going to make its way up to the private sector then prices of goods would be falling. But the fact that prices of gold and the euro are moving up is not at all correlated with the dollar being weak because the FED has pumped so much money into the system.  This leads us to a very important part of quantitative easing and the current ""twist"". People look for the reasons to invest outside of the stock market or even outside of the dollar when price are rising. The 2 places that people look to put their funds is gold and the euro. If the money from quantitative easing is going into gold or even the euro then that means that the FED is helping to finance gold and the euro.  But if you know that all currencies are controlled by the government then you also have to realize that all currencies are also ""saving accounts"" that the FED and the US government control.  This is an important point as this is the primary reason why the FED has to rethink their policy of quantitative easing as they want to do what is best for them. If the FED wants to keep gold in the private sector then they need to limit the amount the private sector is able to buy the dollar. Since the only way to get dollars into the hands of the private sector is if they borrow from the FED or other central banks then that means that they need to put an amount cap on how much any one institution is able to borrow with the policy ""Quantitative easing"". The limit on foreign investment is done through the FX market which is where gold and the euro are traded. Since the private sector is able to move their gold into the dollar then they are able to invest in the dollar and that makes gold go up in price. So the ""twist"" is basically a way for the federal reserve to cap gold and the euro. This would be needed to stop foreign investors from getting into the dollar.  In regards to the euro being traded in the FX market the FED would be trying to put a cap on the price of euros, so they put the bid price of the euro up to the 1.30 dollar. This bid would be kept up until they would be forced to raise the dollar again. It works both ways because if the euro starts going lower than the price they have for it in the FX market then they will buy to support the dollar again, but at the current price as it is now, they don't need to raise the price of the dollar as the price of the euro is rising in the FX market. This is really what the ""Operation Twist"" is all about, it is all about what the FED feels they need in order to make gold move up in price and stay strong.","First, a quick history of where we are for interest rate policy: the federal funds rate has been essentially stuck around 0% from 2007 until now and the Federal Reserve announced on December 12, 2012 that ""The Committee expects that a highly accommodative   stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable   time after the economic recovery strengthens."" That is a big change to what we were prior to 2008, and basically set the stage for operation Twist. In the late 1980s, the economy was in a recession, the federal funds rate was at around 10%. The federal reserve took several actions to drop the rate to 8% over a series of actions from October 1986 to September 1987, where the rate ended up at 8%. These changes were then continued on to lower the rate down to 3% over several  steps over the next 12 months: the actions taken at these times included increasing  holdings of treasury issues and agency mortgage-backed securities. The current move for the federal funds rate is to 0.25% over a series of steps in 2013. The recent ""twist"" is to increase the length of time for which the monetary policy is in place by shifting funds from short-term government bonds to longer-term treasury bonds held by the Fed."
[INST] LLC: Where should the funds for initial startup costs come from? [/INST],"I don't know about UK law, but in the US there are limits as to what you can bring in the LLCs capital stock. For an LLC in the state of Delaware, they are currently (at the time of this writing) $18,000 for each person or entity that brings in the money. If one person wants to cover the entire amount then they can bring in $900,000 without paying the $300 fee. This means you also may not want to bring it in too quickly. In this scenario the first dollar would come from one person, and then the others would trickle in to bring the capital up a little at a time. If you can convince everyone to bring in as close as possible to the magic $50,000 line then you all just save $150,000 in fees. In any case if the money is from an investment source, then in my opinion this is the best way to be able to cover the costs of doing business and to avoid future issues with a large amount of money being tied up in one source with the potential of that source not renewing or just pulling your money out at some point. There was another question yesterday that asked what to do with funds that are needed in one year, but are received as a bonus next month, and I answered that investing in a money market account might be best since with $25,000 there's not going to be a guaranteed rate of return that you can count on for paying back the investment. And, in fact, I had said something like, 'be sure you have other financial options'.  And you were asking what the 'other financial options' were.   First, keep in mind that there are things that cost money that, if not covered, will be coming out of the capital. For instance, the money to file the LLC will often cost money. If that is incurred with a credit card and the plan is to pay the card off right away it could prevent it from showing up on your credit reports for at least several months. You can see how this could be a good idea for some people and a bad idea for others.   If you were going to take your friends' and family's money and use their money then you should be sure that you give them the same legal status if you would take their money and invest it in a venture (which could turn around and lose money instead of gain) If you wanted to keep your friends invested but pay back the debt later, then you could consider loans or installment payments to everyone.","An LLC can be structured in multiple ways (in terms of operating agreement) and while I am not an accountant or a lawyer, it appears that the common way is to fund it initially through personal contributions and then treat those as equity. As such you can have partners pay into a fund (ie. as you've identified personal funds, cash in bank accounts, investments, real estate etc), and then use the proceeds to invest in the LLC activity.  It is not uncommon (in fact quite common) to see multiple partner equity contributions, and the accounting will then simply allocate the percentage of equity each individual holds as per the operating agreement, which will have been set up and agreed upon by the partners. Please look up operating agreements in your state."
[INST] Which U.S. online discount broker is the best value for money? [/INST],I have used E*TRADE for many years. Last year they doubled my dividend yield credit percentage from 1.00% to 2.00%. As such their dividend yield is higher than the other discount banks by roughly 1/2 or higher (if you have an account with several thousand). I would suggest talking to them to see if they would match. Note that I am also receiving higher dividends (2.00% vs 1.00%) in my account and paying 6 cents less per trade.  I have recently tried Sharebuilder and TradeKing and both of them are excellent as well. I can't give a better comparison on the other banks since I don't use them.  So far from my experience E*TRADE is the best for a single trader and their new Sharebuilder is a close second.,"I would think it would be tough to beat Fidelity, as of 2017 they have waived all transaction fees for stocks (limit of $10000, buy, but not sell, the buy transaction fee waived up to $2 million per year). However, if you want to do short term trades, you may want a house with free trades on the long (held 61 days or more) side, as there is a 20% tax on your profits if you made them in less than 61 days."
"[INST] Theoretically, if I bought more than 50% of a company's stocks, will I own the company? [/INST]","Theoretically? Not usually.  To me this reads as, ""if it's possible."" Usually not possible. 50%+1/2 = 50.5%. The problem is that you will never  own 50.5% unless you take 50% + 1/2 of the company. And that's very hard to do. Voting is usually one of the key features that comes with owning one percent.  In short voting is power, 50.5% of voting power is a considerable amount of power in any company, the CEO, CFO, COO would all have to have votes against them to be removed. So a single person acquiring all that power would almost certainly mean a change in direction for the company and a change in all of the top tier positions.","Theoretically, you would own the entire company. However, your ownership would be in the form of stock and not in legal ownership of the business. When a person owns stocks, they do not own the business, but a right to some portion of the income and assets of the business in proportion to the number of shares held. Also in the case of a stock company with legal rights to the business, there can be other shareholders and the bylaws and regulations of the company can dictate how much of the company can be owned by each individual. Additionally, depending upon the legal jurisdiction of the company, the bylaws of the company can dictate that a certain percentage of the stock must remain free for sale, thus not allowing any individual to have sole ownership of the company."
"[INST] Do I need to report to FInCEN if I had greater than $10,000 worth of bitcoin in a foreign bitcoin exchange? [/INST]","If you are operating as a ""money transmitter"" or ""money services business"" (MSB), then yes, you must report your proceeds and funds to FinCEN, to the IRS and to your state Department of Financial Institutions, as regulated by the Bank Secrecy Act. See 31 CFR 1020 Subpart A and B. http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/ Federal regulations require you to submit a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Account to the Department of the Treasury if the total balance of your accounts during the calendar year was greater than $10,000. If you are an individual, that means completing and submitting Form TD F 90-22.1 to FinCEN and to the Treasury Department. If you're doing this as a business, you need to determine if you are a 'reportable person' and complete and submit form TD F 90-22.09 to the Treasury Department. A single entity or legal entity is a 'reportable person' if at any time during the calendar year, one or more accounts as defined above, were maintained by the person. See 31 CFR 103.22 and 31 CFR 103.24 The reporting person is the person filing the TD F 90-22.1 or TD F 90-22.09 with FinCEN; not necessarily the person who owns the account(s). Do consult financial advisors and/or attorneys regarding this matter and the related financial and criminal consequences in your jurisdiction.","The requirements above seem to address your question: In addition, FinCEN  provided guidance on the reporting obligations of   virtual currency user when depositing, trading or transacting with   bitcoin. If a bitcoin user  receives/deposits more than  $10,000 from a   single source in a single day, there is a   reporting obligation. The bitcoin exchanger is   responsible for filing the report. So as long as you are reporting all deposits and withdrawals of bitcoin to the exchange you deposit the bitcoin into, the exchange does the $10,000 reporting for you. Note this question was answered using information about US banks, but I believe the requirement is a country-by-country requirement for AML and is not necessarily exclusive to the United States."
[INST] Auto Loan and Balance Transfer [/INST],"It's pretty easy to have your balance transferred to another card in a way which makes it less likely to occur again. Credit card companies usually offer a feature on their cards that allows you to get a monthly statement, on paper of course, either mailed or delivered to your local financial institution.  Then, instead of paying the balance due all at once, the statement comes on the 5th or whatever day, you then write the check you need to pay and deposit it by the end of the statement period.  That is, instead of paying on the 24th, you pay early and pay in full. Your balance will be transferred automatically each month, and your debt will keep getting paid.","If you were paying the loan (or refi) at 3.4% and are now paying them 10.74%, you are obviously spending more each month, because that amount of extra interest each year is far more than the amount of the $0.50 monthly auto insurance payment.  Yes.  You're going to pay them more on the loan, each month, and at a much higher rate. Also, you obviously took out this credit card solely to save 5 cents per month on car insurance premiums.   You need to pay more attention to the details.   If you can't keep track of these things, you're not going to make financial progress, and you're going to keep needing to ask us these questions.  Here's a site to track your debts:  http://www.mint.com/ There's an app for android.  I use it, and it's very helpful to keep track of everything, and keep things paid off quickly. To your point about it being 'free money' to borrow the $3,300 and paying it off the credit card - don't do that, with the amount of interest you're now being charged, that's just silly.  You probably won't be able to pay it all off within the interest grace period. You need to take a course in personal finance, like Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University.  That's going to be the only way for you to get out of this vicious cycle of borrowing to pay off other bills, only to accumulate debt faster than you can get ahead.  It's a trap that only works for the lenders."
[INST] Personal Tax Return software for Linux? [/INST],"There are multiple questions: What kind of tax returns are you referring to? e.g. federal, state, or both? Are you talking personal or company tax forms? You might want to look into GNUCash for your accounting needs. (I'm not sure if it can do all the tax forms you need, but it seems to have enough to be helpful.) There are alternatives to QuickBooks for accounting software, but they don't all handle tax forms. If you already know you need a certain tax form then search for software specifically developed for that kind of tax form.","Since the question has been generalized to personal income tax the question you are interested in is which software can do federal and 46 state income taxes, so you would want to search for software that will do federal and 46 state returns: GnuCash: See below. iFreeTax: See below"
"[INST] If earning as freelancer, is it better to be a Sole Trader or Limited Company? [/INST]","The problem with having your whole personal assets available for the claims of others is the risk of bankruptcy.  Your credit rating may be wrecked so you will be shut out from acquiring credit, or when you come to want finance some personal expenditure or project that you had thought of doing. You cannot give a mortgage application an honest answer about your financial circumstances without telling the whole truth, so you lose the chance of a mortgage loan to help your family (if you ever want to sell up and move).  A good accountant would find ways to pay yourself a salary that was tax efficient.  They would help you to do this.  There would be no chance of paying tax evasion prosecution for you, and the worst the IR would do is take you up about minor clerical anomalies if the accounting was done accurately and correctly.  A small sole trader could easily pay far less corporation tax than a sole trader pays income tax as a sole trader will have much higher marginal rate. You don’t have Pension Liability, or many other liabilities, as a company and as long as you do not borrow money for the company (which needs to be done wisely given the high interest rates on loans) you won’t end up paying your house off to a lender who decided to foreclose the loan if you can’t keep up payments.  I would say to your friend that any decision should be based on whether it is good for the business, because if the business succeeds better then the person, and the more successful the business the better is their prospects for earning a decent living wage.  If the business does not succeed then the company can be dissolved and the director is not liable to pay debts.  His family is also not liable for business debts as long as they are not a lender (if they provided a bank loan or overdraft facility to the company or some other service to the company in some way where a formal contract was signed)","First, look at all your options.  You may opt for a self-employed person, but maybe you can incorporate as LLC.  You may look at incorporating in Canada, US, UK, Ireland to take advantage of each country's tax laws; this will cost you extra money, but you may save money in taxes overall, so you should look into it.  If you're an American citizen, you also have to look into the FEIE tax advantage. Another consideration is your current situation.  If you're just starting, you could probably do this yourself.  However, you should get a professional (CPA/EA) to take care of your business and personal taxes because you will be mixing and matching personal and business expenses.  The CPA/EA will likely charge you the first year, and then be available for you in the future for any assistance or advice.  Keep in mind, if you have a small or mid-sized business, you can still use a CPA/EA (just as you would for your personal taxes) rather than hiring an expensive law firm for your business incorporation.  If you're an employee, then you may prefer being freelancer rather than part-time contractor, which may involve you losing some benefits such as retirement savings, healthcare, etc.  However, this is a matter of contract, and I think companies treat part-time and contractors fairly differently as far as benefits are concerned. This may or may not be the case in your area.  Look at it both ways to get a feel for what you may prefer, then talk with a CPA/EA to iron out the details.  And remember, if you're working for a corporation, you may not even have this decision made for you, as you'll probably have to be paid through the company's regular payroll system anyway (assuming you are a contractor, not an employee). Just as a side note, your question really should be updated to include ""contract worker"" (e.g. I work as a part-time contractor, rather than freelancer), but you may be able to determine it from the context."
[INST] Impact on Credit Worthiness (Getting A Loan with a Co-signer vs without) [/INST],"For two people with the same exact credit score, your interest rate will largely be determined by your debt to income ratio.   If you have zero credit history (which it sounds like by your comment ""I have no credit score"" you do), then your debt to income ratio will be zero. This typically isn't enough income to qualify, but if you can find someone who is willing to cosign for you then they won't check your credit at all.   If you qualify for the loan with your own income, then the other factors such as credit history become important.  Having a co-signer could help you if you have a history of paying late bills, missed payments or other issues on your account. It's tough to get a loan with no credit history.  You aren't applying for a credit card or some other small loan, you are applying for a car loan. If you need a car you need a cosigner, period.  It could help with a credit card, but not with a car loan. The credit card companies are looking for you to repay the entire balance each month to make money off of that ""convenience"" fee that you have.  Most car loans are paid off over a period of years.","In my personal experience (borrowing 100K for a car), the amount you put down doesn't affect the interest rate, it mostly affects the payments.  As stated in another answer--it all depends on your situation and negotiation skills. Personally, getting co-signed by my father is the reason I was able to get approved for a 240K loan on about 85K income (this was in 2007). Without his help, I would have never qualified for the amount I needed.  The problem started when rates started to creep up, but I don't honestly know how much is my situation vs the rate."
[INST] What's the best gold investment strategy for a Singapore resident? [/INST],"You must understand the context about Singapore. Singapore is part of SEA (Southeast Asia), and if this is the only area you are looking at as part of diversifying and minimizing risk of investments. You should be careful. I will recommend you to at least look at the top financial markets in the world to diversify and lessen your risks. For gold to be a good hedge against risk in an environment of uncertainty, it has to be bought. The reason being, if a person is looking to buy gold, they should look at the gold price in USD. If you look at the USD/SGD exchange rate, you would see that the SGD is considered one of the highest. This is because SGD is considered a safe heaven and there is a lot of demand for the currency especially during times of crisis where investors are running out of their countries to the SGD. There are several countries running out of money, hence the SGD is appreciated. Now when you look at gold, do you think investors are selling all their gold for SGD, hence raising the USD value of gold to protect themselves? What about the rising wages in Singapore? Well, what is happening is, as mentioned above, gold in the world have been increasing in demand. Many investors are now looking at gold as a hedge against the economic uncertainties. So if you are trying to hedge against risks, gold isn't looking bad especially in the current market environment currently. In times of crisis, what do many companies and countries do in an attempt to alleviate the pressure on themselves? Well, they print money which will always come back and bite the economies in the form of rising gold prices.","The answer to your query should be very straightforward, considering the high level.  You simply divide your money between ETFs holding mining companies, royalty-bearing companies and physical. There are two reasons why you should divide your money between these categories and one reason why not to buy mining companies. The first reason why you should divide your money between categories is that they have different risks.  If the price of gold increases or stays about the same over a short period of time, shares of miners will perform better while physical gold (or any physical) will move up or down less sharply.   However, if gold depreciates over a long period of time, shares are hit the hardest.  There's a certain level of gold production that needs to be reached in order to keep gold shares afloat since the company needs to repay bondholders and shareholders, but more gold is produced as the price of gold rises.  Eventually the company has to decide whether it wants to keep operations running or whether it wants to sell itself, at this time a large percentage of the market cap may be wiped out with one sale.  This is why royalites are a safer investment over the long-term.  They still suffer fluctuations in the gold price, but over their lifetime they are worth more in gold than gold itself is worth because some of the gold is held as physical, and so they have no operating expenses and they have more certainty that they will be paid.  ETFs of these companies may fluctuate in the short-term due to their gold price (just like the miners), but they are still safer due to their royalty claims.   The second reason why you should be diversify your holdings is that gold is a volatile asset.   Diversify because a high percentage of your money in one particular investment vehicle may result in a major loss that you don't have the funds to make up, causing a snowball effect when your other assets go in the same direction. And here's the reason why you should not buy mining shares.  They are just as risky as a biotech company, and when that sector goes down, you could end up losing your shirt while gold rises.  A mining share is levered, and so its value will increase a lot more because gold rises faster, and it will be wiped out by any major setback.  ETF hold shares will be much more stable. Here is a list of the ETFs I would consider holding in Singapore.  I've been trading them for a while, and have made money on them all. However you should carefully research each ETF before buying it to make sure that it is still trading in Singapore, and also do your due diligence to make sure you know what you're buying.  Here's a list of ETFs with a low cost that I recommend buying. If you follow my advice above, you will probably be very happy with your investment. Note that I did not include GIY and IBRL because they were sold off when the gold markets rose to $1600."
[INST] What should I be doing to protect myself from identity theft? [/INST],"My first move would be to obtain copies of all the credit reports and credit score for you to review. Review this carefully to find any discrepancies in your history and/or unauthorized use of your personal information. As you review the report, you may find that you have an inaccuracy; if this is the case, you need to follow up with the credit reporting agency immediately to get all the pertinent information corrected. One of the best ways to obtain a copy of your credit report is to utilize a free service offered by the federal government through http://ftc.gov/credit. Also, if you find that you have any unauthorized usage of your personal information it is vital that you follow with the agency and file a dispute within 30 days. This will ensure that you aren't held liable under any circumstances. You can also protect yourself by reviewing your credit report and/or setting up credit monitoring services that will alert you if there are any significant items that appear on your credit report. This service will most likely cost you money overtime but will give you peace of mind that you can keep a close eye on where your credit is heading.","There are a wealth of good answers to questions in this area, including many from myself (I've been a target for ID Fraud for years), but one answer that is often overlooked is the use of credit/debit card fraud security protocols provided by the individual fraud departments of card lenders. These are, in most cases, easily accessed via a toll free telephone number that is printed on the back of the cards.  Generally any of a variety of requests can be made to help prevent or reduce the chance for ID theft, including things like limiting debit card use to local ATM withdrawals only (you can still make debit card purchases with no trouble at all), limiting credit card transactions to a certain amount, closing accounts, or limiting when a particular card may be used.  You may also be able to choose whether all of your accounts with a particular lender get an alert (generally via an email) when a purchase is made, and which type of alerts you want for individual accounts.  Finally, most companies that offer these services will put an automatic fraud alert on all types of cards you use (i.e. charge, debit) if the lender is contacted to say you don't have (i.e. can't have) an account with them.  The purpose of this is that when you open an account with your bank or another company, the provider asks the lender to confirm an existing account with the person opening the new account."
[INST] Why can't I short a stock that sells for less than $5? Is there another way to “go short” on them? [/INST],"To be able to sell short, you first need to find a counterparty to agree to purchase the shares from you at a later date (at a price you have designated). The larger the market price the shorter the time you may need to wait. In Australia, ASX Short Notes are now trading for a minimum of 22 days. The ability to obtain the stock you wish to sell short may be limited by a shortage. If you look at the Short Interest data for ASX, there is very limited short interest in small company stocks (i.e. less than $5) due to the lack of counterparty to perform the short sale. There are many people on the long side of these stocks, but very few looking to go short.  Some counterparties won't lend certain stocks so you don't get the option to sell them.  For example, many US brokerages will not lend the shares of small and volatile tech stocks because they feel that with a small float the market can shift without notice.","It seems there are two misconceptions here.  First, a stock does not need to be on a U.S. exchange to be traded in the United States. Stock that has never been listed or has been removed from U.S. exchanges are often found on OTC exchanges.  Trades in such shares must be arranged through a broker who maintains a market making arrangement.  When a broker has such arrangement, they are generally known as market makers.  In many cases, the market maker that maintains the market price is the original underwriter of the issue.  Sometimes there are also specialists involved.  So, just because a stock is listed on an exchange other than the Big Board, a broker can still arrange for you to buy or sell at that exchange.  So this is the answer to the first apparent misconception.  It's not a broker that has the final say on whether a given share can be shorted or not.  It's the exchange. There's another misconception going on in all the answers so far.  In order to short a given stock, a broker will need to be able to short it in order to be willing to facilitate your transactions.  A broker that is not allowed by its customers or the exchange from which the broker maintains a ""market maker"" arrangement to short will, of course, be unable to allow you short the particular stock being discussed.  However, a broker that has been requested by its customers to allow shorting will accept its corresponding responsibilities of ensuring it will be able to facilitate any such requests.  There many reasons why shares on a particular exchange might not be available for shorting.  Here are some examples of such reasons: A broker may have determined that based on customer requests it will have to be able to short a given stock and so is in the process of arranging for that market making arrangement.    It may also be that a stock that might be able to be shorted at a ""non-U.S. exchange"" is not tradeable in the U.S. (meaning there is no market in this issue).  That stock may be only listed on an exchange outside the U.S. and might never have been offered in the U.S. The broker may not have an arrangement yet (or may not have decided yet based on customer requests that shorting this stock will be allowed) It might be that a broker has recently sold a customer some shares and the seller is still subject to a 3 day settlement period before being able to tender the shares at settlement. It may be that there's no one wanting to buy the shares; perhaps because they are considered ""illiquid"" or because there's not yet significant trading volume in that stock or because of a poor news flow on that stock.  If no one is buying, then why would a share be available to short (assuming the broker does allow shorting)?  In the end it's all about the customer requests and who's willing to sell at the other end of the trade."
[INST] What are pros and cons of volatility trading over directional stock trading [/INST],"One major difference is that if you hold the volatility contract all the way to expiration, it will always be worth $100; where as a stock, you can win or lose and you will know more exactly only at expiration, if the stock has gone up or down relative to your choice over that time frame. Of course, a stock can pay dividends, while the volatility instrument will not. On the plus side, if the stock does go down $10 and in the same time period the implied volatility goes down, the premium you paid will be less than what you will get. This is a double hedge, but this may still be a good deal overall since you bet that the stock won't rise or fall too much, and, indeed, it didn't. However, that is assuming that the implied volatility contract is accurate, and that there's no volatility skew.","Well first lets define what volatility actually is. One common measure uses the average deviation or variance across the historical prices of a given series of prices. To be more precise in the case of a series of stock prices: As you can see, this simple moving average deviation has little to do with the actual direction an entity is moving in. The problem with this definition however is in the application. If you want to trade volatility you would need to calculate that average price variance for each stock before the period of time the trade would be taking place in, and then measure the variance of the average variance throughout the period of your trade. If you want to go this route you will find that you need very large data sets. For this reason, many traders use the log rate of change (LOG RC) to measure volatility. The more common application of the measure is to determine expected future return: The assumption here is that higher average volatility will translate to higher expected standard deviation. What one might wish to know however is whether volatility is a good indicator of future expected return on risk adjusted terms. It seems like this may be the case for long equity positions, however there are other considerations in play as well. The stock market in general has shown to have a negative skew with many excess returns coming after crashes. This would cause the mean and median deviations of return to go in opposite directions. This also supports the theory that you may be able to earn more by investing in less efficient sectors later in a cycle. It is very difficult however to isolate the variance of returns due to cyclical returns in this way, especially with the large data requirements."
[INST] Layman's guide to getting started with Forex (foreign exchange trading)? [/INST],"My personal strategy, as a beginner, would be to study fundamentals such as the economic cycle, which will give you an insight into what sort of factors affect exchange rates and the direction of the economy of a given country. You should also study the markets and economic conditions of a country that you would like to invest in, rather than buying on emotion or based on what you've heard from a friend. You should also get familiar with technical analysis (e.g. moving averages, oscillators, stochastics, patterns, etc.) before attempting to trade. This will help you identify short-term trends to determine where you get a better deal on buying or selling a currency. After you have a firm grasp on the fundamentals and the various technical analysis techniques, you should then start trading, preferably with a demo account until you get the hang of it, or trade in small positions until you see a better rate than the market.","As a novice investor to forex I made two good decisions.  First, I began by watching and researching the markets for about a year.  I read a bunch of books that I got from the library, I followed various trading websites, and I kept up with the markets for about a year before I put in my first trade. Secondly, for my first trade, I started very small and placed a stop loss 30 pips from my entry point.  Over the course of a few weeks I placed around 10 trades and I got in and out the market by moving both my entry into my stop loss, and my exit point a few pips beyond my entry point.  That way I did very few losing trades, I profited when the market moved in my direction, and I learned more about the different pairs as well as the ways I like trade the market. If you follow this strategy, then I would recommend that you choose a currency pairing that you will consistently put your money into and a currency pairing that you will consistently trade against.  This will give you two sides to the market so you can see how trade goes as well as have two options for entry points. I do not believe you need to do any technical analysis to succeed in forex, but you will need a stop loss and exit point for any trades you use."
"[INST] If I own x% of company A, and A buys company B, do I own x% of B? [/INST]","No, you don't own x% of B by default, if B goes public then you can decide. Suppose that after the stock market closes.  Company A and Company B agree in principle to a merger. (As you can see, there are a number of complicating factors that were simplified in my original answer.) They agree on a stock swapping ratio of 0.8 shares of Company B for each share of Company A.  Before the announcement that the merger ""goes through"", A is trading at 15 a share and B is trading at 10 a share.  It looks like a decent deal to go ahead.   On the next day the market closes and it turns out A and B announce that the merger is off because one company doesn't want to go forward with the deal.  On the market the prices start to shift rapidly,  A is now trading at 14 while B is now at 11,  clearly it was a bad deal for A to go forward with.  So now if you owned 1 share of A you own $14.00 dollars and if you owned 1 share of B you own, what,  $11.00?  The price of B dropped because of this news, is this fair?  Well, you could argue it wasn't and B should be at a higher value.  Now it could also be that when A and B announced a merger between them, shares of another company (C) dropped from its trading price to 4,  as that company is being passed by in mergers and acquisition.  Clearly the merger between B and A won't be good for them unless C was also in the deal.  This is complicated though, just take a look at what has happened since the merger between A and B fell apart.  While B dropped and went down to 11 a share,  a share of C dropped to 3.  Now maybe C is a good investment because the B/A merger fell apart or maybe not so good.  If you thought the B/A merger was a good idea maybe C should be going up, if you thought it was a bad idea then it should be down.  Which is why at the end of the next day the market open's the stock of C drops and you see it start to pick up, if everyone thought it was a bad idea then the price starts falling.","Yes, technically you should, but there can be a difference in corporate ownership. For example, if the A stockholder is a separate person from the controlling owners, the controlling owners of the B company have the discretion of issuing shares to themselves, thus making the person who holds control of only the A company end up with a smaller portion of both companies. To add to that, if the stockholder of A was given only common control stock in A and not all shares, then he could have a very small percentage of the voting of shares of that company.  That company can then spin off a new shares of stock to be traded on the market, and this means that he is a minority stockholder in that company, as the stock is issued to raise funds for the company.  And finally, if he sold part of his stake in B, that means that some of the common shares of A get sold as part of the deal. Another good example is that a stock split will result in a higher number of total shares but that percentage of shares does not change because you need to give someone the extra common shares in order to increase the shareholder's stake and this dilutes the controlling party's stake in that company."
[INST] Is the money you get from shorting a stock free to use for going long on other stocks? [/INST],"Nope.  You get this in the form of collateral; in most cases cash sitting in a clearing account. If your broker doesn't have enough margin to lend, then they have the ability to get the loan for you from other clearing firms on a net basis. It's also why you might see some accounts allow you to not have to pay margin interest. These accounts just ""sell"" the stock, but hold the shares for the client. In your case, you are lending someone else your shares for them to sell; the broker acts the middle man and ensures that you get your shares paid for, net of borrow fees, and then uses your collateral for other firms in their clearing house. There are tax issues as well. If you are shorting your own stock, you might have just sold yourself the shares, and have already been taxed on those ""sales proceeds"" (and perhaps you get a CGT event).","You cannot hold your short at the same time as a long position (for the same stock). You have to square the position by one (long or short). Shorting a stock requires either margin or cash money.  You have to put in 100% of the value of the shares you short in  margin account, plus interest on that margin. If you don't have the 100% cash, you will then be required to deposit other cash into the margin account. If the margin account has less than 100% and your position gets squeezed even further, then the broker can liquidate the position and sell your shares to get the cash. There are many instances where someone could use that margin amount to buy more shares of other assets. However, you can't do it with the stock that you shorted."

[INST] What part of buying a house would make my net worth go down? [/INST],"If you're putting money into your home - for example, replacing a roof or painting - that would decrease your net worth. Additionally, if you have a mortgage you should include the monthly payment as expense and include the mortgage balance as debt for a more accurate snapshot of your finances (and you can also reduce your mortgage by paying early and pay down some of the principal earlier than usual). If your mortgage is paid off though you really should take it out of your expenses and out of your debt.","If money was ""gifted"" to you, that means somebody else paid your down payment, closing costs, and/or some of your monthly mortgage payments.  What percentage of each of those things is determined by your family situation and the agreements that were made.  If the cash was truly a gift -- that is, never to be paid back -- what happens when the house is sold (or if you need to foreclose due to loss of employment, etc.)? When you purchase a home, you get some money back when you sell, but you also repay some interest on the loan, but don't recoup the full value of the loan.  If that loan was gift money, those same calculations apply.  Your Net Worth doesn't automatically increase, it increases (or decreases) from the closing and settlement of the property.  Until that sale, you still have a loan balance and debt owed against your Net Worth.  That's also one reason you take a mortgage -- it's not a gift to keep.  You have to find the value when you buy and sell, apply various interest rates and the loan amortization schedule, then compare the results. If you purchased the home for $85,000, and your sales price today is $92,000, and you paid $4,455 in property taxes this year alone, and $16k in P&I payments this year, and another $2,000 in HOA fees, you could subtract some of those as you compute net change -- if the money is a gift, you may not be able to deduct it, and that's something to ask your accountant about.  If you had some capital repairs done as well, there are a few other ways to measure ROI, but a lot of this information is in your locality's appraised records.   On a net income basis, if you've paid $255.55 a month so far towards mortgage and $200 a month towards P&I, then you only received $55.55 towards the building equity position of your house by comparison."
[INST] Where should I park my money if I'm pessimistic about the economy and I think there will be high inflation? [/INST],"Inflation doesn't mean you would ever actually want to use your money to buy something, because your purchasing power would drop so fast that your money is practically worthless. So your goal is to avoid devaluing your money.  It might help you, but may also confuse you, to compare what people used to do instead of holding currency- the stock market.  People used to be so scared of losing their money in the stock market, they would buy government bonds, so their own government was less likely to confiscate their savings by devaluing their currency.  Now that so many people are investing in equities, the government often has to borrow the people's money.  So currency is more closely tied to what they use stocks (or perhaps the stock market as a whole in the case of a ""diversified portfolio"") than the stock market per se.   However, governments are still less than fully trustworthy.  With all of the devaluations in currency, governments have been devaluing people's savings (whether by printing more money or confiscating wealth through a variety of measures, etc.), so there are people who have lost a lot of money in governments they trusted (such as Germany in the early 20th century or the United States in the 21st).  So they no longer trust the government to give them a fair deal, or even pay any interest at all.  Instead they ""buy gold"".  Gold never depreciates (if it does, it isn't gold, it's some imposter metal).  (You may wonder why it was necessary for me to put quotes around gold, when gold is real and money is fake?  Gold is a real metal with no intrinsic value that's only useful because people collectively agree that it is.  Money is a system for exchanging value; if you use only gold you still have an exchange system.  The problem is that a gold-based currency is a system that doesn't change and can't change with the economy, so it ends up being unwieldy to use and is hard to store.  That's why people trade paper/plastic cash and gold for something that is easier to trade.)  So people invest in gold and other metals because they are supposed to rise in price with inflation, or to hedge against it, assuming that if the central banks were able to devalue the currency, they couldn't magically create an endless supply of gold to match the devaluation.  Instead of ""buying gold"", which is a misnomer, you ""sell paper cash in the foreign exchange market"", since gold is more a form of cash that other people will pay the same amount for everywhere.  You then deposit this gold in gold ETFs, which, instead of tracking the price of gold, they track gold deposits in the vault of the ETF company, which takes money from buyers and pays gold to sellers.  You are then supposed to get dividends from them instead of interest.  However, since they would never pay interest, you should be wary of investing in them.  The most recent dividend paid was $99 million dollars in dividends on August 1, 2011, which works out to 4.2% annualized given a share price of $15.96 that day.  When the Federal Reserve's policy in the United States (where the ETF is located, as far as I can tell) is to keep interest rates near zero until 2014, you shouldn't expect to get interest on your savings from them. So the gold ETF SGOL is the most inflation-hedging you can get given the amount of inflation we have currently and are foreseeable to get.","I am going to do a quick review of the question, my answer, and some points on alternatives for your consideration. The short answer is; if you are pessimistic about the economy and are looking for a simple way to preserve your savings, you should consider looking into Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS).  This response will be based only on publicly available information gathered through Internet searching. When you look for the correct answer, it is important that you find the most up-to-date information. A good way to do this is to search for something like ""How to shield savings from high inflation."" If you would like more information on this subject please look into buying one of the many books on the topic. The questions you should ask before deciding on TIPS are:  ""Would you be better off taking some of your money and investing it in different financial instruments (Stocks, Bonds, Gold, Silver, Other) to diversify your portfolio?"" ""Would it provide more diversification and stability for my portfolio if I looked into TIPS in combination with another financial instrument? This could be things like Treasury Bonds - which are NOT inflation protected, and thus may have risk of inflation but the rates are higher, or a more diversified portfolio of stocks or investments in which you believe will increase in value and offset inflation."" If you do decide to diversify, I would recommend checking out the question titled ""Find a good way to diversify my savings."" ""What time period do you expect to hold these instruments?"" (e.g. Is this a long term or short term purchase?) ""How much are you willing to risk your savings in the process (risk appetite)?"" ""Do you have other savings and investments, and how would the addition of your desired portfolio be affected by these?"" The points described above can be found in the response ""What are the advantages of diversifying versus investing all my money?"" as well as in the question ""What is a diversified portfolio?"" TIPS are part of the Treasury Bond market and the general bond market and are influenced by the general bond market. Inflation is typically linked with low interest rates, and as interest rates are lowered, investors put money into bonds which makes them more expensive/rare, raising the price and lowering the yield, meaning any interest rates are low. In TIPS the inflation rate is calculated based on the current interest rate and the inflation expectation based upon forward-looking market indicators. When TIPS are purchased, the principle is not adjusted, nor is the face value, merely the interest is adjusted. It is possible that the principle of the investment can be devalued to lower principle.  The current TIPS yield is generally seen to be low and is comparable to current 2 and 3 year old treasuries. There are a wide range of TIPS maturities:  There are several alternatives to the above including;  I would ask further questions and decide how suitable some or all of these are based upon your time frame, risk appetite, and other factors. There are also various bond markets with which one could invest, most notably the long term bond market - which can be found here. If you look through the various articles on inflation you will find a wide range of reasons for and against investing in TIPs including many reasons to invest, many reason not to invest, and the majority reason that many suggest is to use TIPS as a portion of a diversified portfolio. You can also use TIPS as a fixed portion of your portfolio to hedge against inflation in a riskier portion of your portfolio but this is a strategy many suggest avoiding."
"[INST] If a stock doesn't pay dividends, then why is the stock worth anything? [/INST]","The current share price of a non-dividend paying stock is the current net present value of the expected future cashflows from the stock. The cashflows from a non-dividend paying stock are (a) the capital gain in terms of the share price in the future, less (b) any dividends that may eventually be paid by the company. The current share price of a non-dividend paying stock is the market's price at which investors are willing to buy and sell shares. The share price is therefore partly set by past and expected future cashflows in the form of dividends.","Stock ownership represents ownership in a fraction of the company, if only in the sense that its value is determined by ""how much"" of the company you own. The share price of a stock is the price people are willing to pay for that fraction. Dividends are just a portion of the shareholder's portion of company profits, which you receive as cash. If you don't receive dividends, that just means the company's board of directors has chosen to hold on to their profits and re-invest them back into the company with the hope of generating bigger payouts in the future. Some companies can be so large, that the return rate on the existing assets is more than the dividend they could pay out, meaning the business could grow larger, and become more valuable without the dividend, than it would if it were paying a dividend.  The other possibility of course is if the company is in loss, or not able to generate the profits to pay you a dividend."
[INST] How is the actual trade on exchanges processed for simple stock orders? [/INST],"The stock order itself and the limit order of the trade are two different transactions. The stock order is done via a broker and the funds are taken from your cash balance (if you sell, you are credited to the funds, if you buy the cash is debited). The market liquidity for that stock is used to then fill the order with either the ask and market orders.   For those who have asked, the actual trade is done via a market-maker for high volume stocks. For low volume stocks, the order is placed between all the firms waiting on the liquidity of the other firms.","There are different types of orders.  One type, a market order, guarantees delivery of shares at the best price.   In effect it ensures that you will have all the shares you want, by taking them even if you pay more.  A limit order guarantees you that you will pay the price you specified (up to a maximum), but does not guarantee you will receive any shares at that price.   The difference is that in a market order (and similar) the seller chooses the price, whereas in a limit order you choose the price. When doing a market order, the system asks all market makers how many shares they have at a given price.  If there's enough shares, your order is filled.  Otherwise it's part-filled."
[INST] How does the price of oil influence the value of currency? [/INST],"There are several reasons why the prices of oil, gold, and other commodities drive the prices of currencies.  In the case of oil, one of the two major forces driving oil price is the amount of currency that a nation has.  The second is the amount of oil that a country expects to need.  In the past, the two major oil producers were the United States and Russia.  In 1973, Russia entered an oil embargo with the United States.  The supply of the world's oil decreased, and the dollar was the only currency that could be used to buy this decreased amount of oil outside of Russia.  The price of oil doubled during this time. The other is that currency is valued by how much oil is available in the world.  A country with lots of oil is going to have a currency that will appreciate because they can print money from oil earnings.","A country has to create money to pay for imports of goods and services - this money is created in the form of interest-bearing treasury bills.  The money created will pay for the imports and pay interest on the bonds.  Also, in order to pay this interest and the taxes due to its citizens, a country has to have a thriving economy - this means that the country has to be producing export goods and services so that it can pay for imports of inputs needed to produce these.  So if the costs of producing the exports increase in relation to the costs of the imports, then the country is at a disadvantage. If oil prices rise, this means that the costs of producing goods and services in the country increase more than input costs to the export markets because energy prices are high within the country.  Therefore, the balance of payments deteriorate and the currency decreases in value in order to correct this unbalanced situation.  Conversely falling oil prices increase the value of the currency."
[INST] How can an Indian citizen get exposure to global markets? [/INST],"There are mutual funds in India that invest only in global markets. For example, Reliance Global Equity and HDFC Global Equity Investors are two options available in India. If you are still sceptical about investing directly in foreign currencies, you should choose one such mutual fund. In this way you will be protected if the Indian currency weakens, and at the same time you also have exposure to global markets. And the management fee charged by one mutual fund is likely to be much less than the amount you would have lost by devaluation of your dollar.","Invest in your domestic market, which is very exposed to the global markets. There are many international corporations operating out of India, which in turn will increase profits and share prices. In addition, this is the direction the entire Indian economy has headed for decades. Therefore, investing in India is investing in a country that is looking to expand and globalize itself. You cannot pick and choose. If you are convinced that something will do well, then you can get exposure to it by investing in the ETF it is in, such as the FTSE, or MSCI, or any various S&P Global indices. There are plenty of them. There are even ETFs that track specific regions of the world. If you want to buy into these types of instruments, however, you will have to pay fees to get these. You also have the option of investing in more diversified global stock ETFs such as Vanguard's Global Growth ETF. However, diversify if you are buying into these. It is too risky to just pick a global growth ETF and buy into it."

This does not have to be your career it should be for fun as you explore different companies and different markets.","What you need to consider: The value of your stock in your portfolio is not the amount of dollars but by the percentage of your whole portfolio.  In general, for younger investors (under age 60 or so), it is recommended a heavy equity stake to allow the portfolio to grow.  However, that's just a general, one-size-fits-all recommendation.  You have to consider your situation to know if this is too much equity and stock.  I know of one example of someone who tried this in earnest and it blew up in his face.  He worked in the biotech industry, heavily invested in biotech companies, and during the market crash of 2008, lost more than half his entire portfolio.   The best way is to consider your overall financial situation and plan from there, but a good place to start is here.  What are you looking to accomplish?  If you are trying to build wealth for retirement or just live comfortably in the future, your asset allocation has a role but it's only the first part of the planning process.

[INST] How can I use tax-advantaged investments to manage my wealth? [/INST],"Most people are familiar with tax advantaged retirement accounts.   The most common would be 401K or 403B plans through your employer.  These are available to everyone (unless you work for the federal government).   Other tax advantaged retirement programs include IRAs, Pensions, and Roth 401K or Roth 403B. There are other programs including Education or Health Care Savings accounts. Health Care Accounts generally start to make financial sense once you in your 50s where your Health Care costs might be over $5000 or $10,000 per year out of pocket to obtain the best care.   For a family of two, the best retirement planning plan could start with a budget of $200,000 for each spouse.   You will need $50 401k plans to start the retirement funds and contribute as much as you can,  plus an IRA of $50 000 to get started.    Most people starting with a little over $1 million should start with a 6% withdrawal plus healthcare savings amount until health costs go over $50K per year.  At $60K per year in Health Care, then the budgeted amount should be increased to $6K per year in withdrawals. A budget of $4 million or more should start with the $6K annual withdrawal plus an addition $350K for Health Care costs.  If health care costs go over $55K, then $40K per years might be required. With an income of $250K per year, it would be wise to save $100K each year towards retirement planning.  That could reduce the retirement budget to $2 or $3 million when you reach retirement age. You would need a Financial Advisor to help decide which specific plan is best for you and your family.  Since these advisors are paid by commissions on the specific programs, be careful when hiring them.  Look at the specific plans that they recommend for you.  Find out who pays them for their advice.  If they are paid by you for their advice only, then the specific plan that they recommend may be better than the one someone else would have recommended to you.  Ask them to get specific about the pros and cons of specific health savings accounts.  Ask them for names of companies where they have had experience.  Use a second source to verify their advice or the information that they give you. There are rules that govern how much of your salary can go into these plans without triggering a significant tax bill.  You can increase these amounts every year or so in order to maximize the amount of money that each year receives the special tax treatment.  Look at these rules; or have them explained by the Financial Advisor that you decide to hire.","You can take advantage of tax-advantaged investments, such as retirement accounts, to save money on taxes and grow your wealth. Other than traditional retirement accounts, you can also consider investing in alternative asset classes to further reduce your tax burden. Another way of managing wealth is through estate planning, which can allow you to reduce or eliminate taxes on inherited assets. Additionally, you can also find alternative investments, such as private equity or private debt, to further grow your wealth and increase your income stream. Finally, you can make charitable donations to minimize your taxes and take advantage of tax deductions."
[INST] Is my employee stock purchase plan a risk free investment? [/INST],"That's correct, you can only sell shares on the last trading day of the holding period (that in your case is exactly the last trading day of the discount period - March 8th (inclusive)). As such, on March 8th you are going to sell the shares at the current market price (let's call it Y1). Since you pay 10 cents of every dollar you get after April 12th, effectively the price you would have to offer the shares on March 8th is 1.3c per share. However in this case you are in effect doing a match with your company for $1. On Tuesday you get the shares at a per-share price of $1.30, and effectively sell them on the same day at a price of 1.3c per share. Now the next time you can sell the shares is in September, when the next 6 month discount period is over. By that date, the price would have possibly increased. You could either sell a part of the shares for 1.30c each, or wait for the full discount period to finish in March 2017, when you would sell the whole lot for the last stock price on the market (let's again call it Y2).   You'll notice that I'm calling the date 22 February 2016 the first Monday of March, and the discount pricing period of 6 month, meaning as long as your employer has signed up for that particular discount period (which could be 5 months or 7 months), the end of the period may be on a Monday, in which case you won't be able to sell all you've earned from the discount until the following trading day.","As mentioned by other answers, you need to be careful about how the money is invested. The shares can be purchased in the open market, without taking into consideration other issues than the general stock price. But the company may buy the shares out of its cash flow, giving them less cash for expansion, dividends, acquisitions, etc. For example, if the purchase price is 100%, the company has to be able to generate enough cash to pay the shares back to the employees on the sale date, or dilute earnings with a public offering. Another risk to consider is that in the case your employer goes into a leveraged buyout, the shares might not be in the capital structure for a payment to the existing shareholders."
[INST] How do I screen for stocks that are near to their 52 weeks low [/INST],"The question you are asking is not really answered by the title. The more important question is: Are you interested in stocks which have dropped in price because the economic conditions have negatively effects on the company, i.e. the drop in price is because the company is fundamentally undervalued, and thus an excellent investment, or are you only interested in stocks which, because of some blip on the price chart in the recent past, dropped for some reason unrelated to the company's fundamentals. The latter is not a sign that the company is good value. And it is this question you will find difficult to answer, because to determine which stocks have dropped for negative fundamental reasons, you will have to understand the fundamental reasons why they fell, which requires research that you, as an amateur, will find difficult (and likely costly).",You can try these ideas to begin:

[INST] Buy and sell stock at specific earnings [/INST],"The best way to accomplish this is to own a dividend bearing ETF.  I prefer VYM over Vanguard's Utilities ETF due to the diversification among a variety of dividend paying stocks (such as ExxonMobil, Caterpillar, and Johnson and Johnson).  Also the dividend payout at year end has more consistency in recent years (at least in comparison to Vanguard REIT's which also pays dividends) which makes it easier to predict an ""expense line item"" you'll be using to pay into the retirement account that holds these investments. You do pay $22/year (annualized cost over 10 years) but if you look at the average $27 dividend payout over the last 10 years, you're still making a profit.   This also comes with the nice additional feature of reinvestment growth within the fund, and the additional benefit of paying less taxes by buying this over holding an individual stock that pays dividends.","This question really depends on your specific goals, but the short answer is yes, it can be done.  Specifically, if your goal is to invest in specific stocks without spending much time watching the markets, and if your plan is to put in $100 at regular intervals. When you buy or sell stock, you will need to pay a commission fee, so it's not free.  You could invest the money in a regular mutual fund or an index mutual fund, but my advice would be that you want to learn about investing in individual stocks and the commissions you pay. The most cost effective way to do this in my opinion is to invest in 20 to 40 stocks every month.  This keeps your commissions under $8 a stock or less.  This could work for you, or not, as your goals must be the main determinant of your plan of action. Good luck."
"[INST] How can it be possible that only ~10% of options expire worthless, and only ~10% are exercised? [/INST]","I think you're confused by the words ""in the money"".  As a very quick example:  You hold a contract on a call with a strike price of 500, and the price is trading for $2.50.  You are ""in the money"" because the stock is trading above the strike price.  But, you're not guaranteed to actually buy the stock at 500 because you can sell the call contract on the secondary market for above 500, like, say, $650.  If you do, that's how you make money from selling something ""in the money"".","First you cannot call or put a stock on the day the strike is in the money more than $0.01, as it is a violation of Rule 155.  A covered call cannot be called as an option (you already own the thing), so it has no value on the expiration date for the holder of the option.  But even if you are long stock it cannot be called.  You can only exercise a put and sell the stock immediately for a wash sale. The next rule is that if the holder of the option wants to buy the stock he or she cannot do so until the exchanges open, and cannot do so 30 minutes before the open.  It's also not a coincidence that many companies report earnings shortly before the expiration date, allowing them to be in-the-money on their options.  A big buy for a stock in the money for $1 can move 10%, and the option holder could only make $0.01 on it. So one can see why a $1 in-the-money option is worthless to an investor in a volatile market, as a new development often causes the stock to gap up or down, causing the option to expire worthless. This article is informative for expiration in general although it mentions another possibility: In addition to a stock's price suddenly changing right before the market close, another reason why options often expire worthless is that the stock's ""implied volatility"" rises due to news of possible takeover activity. In other words, options become more valuable when a stock's share price could change wildly, like it does when an acquisition, merger or spin-off is taking place. In such cases, a stock's current implied volatility skyrockets, increasing the possibility that the stock's price could move high enough beyond the strike to cause an option to be in-"

Stocks with dividends give you two possible ways to profit: the total value of shares of stocks in the future, and dividends that are paid along the way. But when markets are bubbling, and everything is expensive, it is very difficult and sometimes impossible to find safe investments. Right now, most US equities are bubbling. So if you are going to buy them, buy stocks that you will keep for a long time. Buying stocks over the long term will do you well. Do as many buy-in options to diversify yourself. Do NOT try to pick on your own. Do NOT try to buy shares of stock, do ETFs. If you plan to buy the stock, you will lose your money and have to pay additional taxes. A good place to get started is Vanguard or Schwabb, or ETrade. E Trades website is also very straightforward and will explain things that I am sure you will ask anyway. You may also want to consider investing in government bonds. If you can, you could also consider real-estate investment in the form of rental property or Real-Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). The latter you can buy as a direct investment, via an ETF or mutual fund. The former you can buy shares of a real-estate fund that invests in REITs, or directly, with ETFs or mutual funds. Another option in this situation is to consider investing in private loans (not personal loans). These are loans that were offered to people with poor credit (in the form of small loans, often to pay medical bills, credit card debt, or a similar scenario), but that the original bank can not collect. The lender gets an annual % of the loan for the duration of the collection process, plus any principal left over (because the interest rates are high, and the interest accrued after 12 years is higher than the total amount to be collected) as this is considered a secondary collection. You would need 100% of the loan to pay. The problem with these loans is that the original amount loaned is often exaggerated because of fees, and there is no guarantee of recovering the money. If you buy your own real estate, think about the cost of buying and the cost or maintenance. If the cost of buying goes down, you may want to consider buying one of these properties, but you should talk to a real banker and a real estate agent and/or broker to get real numbers. For buying real estate, get into real estate with a limited partner or a real estate investment fund. It is important to note that I have no experience with investment properties, so do not treat this as a recommendation. My wife and I may invest some funds (not a large amount to start with) into rental real estate, as we are looking to buy a house in the next 6 months. I'm wondering what would be the best way to invest some money at this time in my life. Why do you want to invest it now? Why do you want to invest it in specific things? The answers you get will be more specific and useful. How much can you afford to lose? What's your risk aversion? Risk aversion is defined as the level of risk that can be taken on without losing money (because it is too risky). If it is high (which it looks like), you will have very little financial security. This is not what you should say. Your answer can only be about money, without knowing the details of the question. If you need to make money today and can risk losing the initial amount you invested (because you could not get a loan from your bank or credit union without overpaying), I would consider direct investment in companies. I would not consider ETFs. The best ETF you can buy is VTI. For investments in companies, I would try VTI. VTI is an ETF with more than 50% of the market. If you are looking for something short-term, you may want to start looking, but you may want to do some research on ETFs or index funds. I would also consider investing in an ETF, but again..."
[INST] Where are Bogleheadian World ETFs or Index funds? [/INST],"If you want a Vanguard total world ETF, I'd recommend: WVMI: This is Vanguard's ""Global Total Stock Market ETF"", tracking the MSCI All Country World Investable Market Index (IWM).  This fund's expense ratio includes 2.01% distribution and servicing fee, 0.10% shareholder servicing fee, and 0.16% Vanguard Investor Shares fee. WFM: This is Vanguard's ""Global Fixed Income ETF"", tracking the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index (AGG). Expense ratio is 0.25%. VLCA. This is Vanguard's ""Total World Stock ETF"", tracking CRSP U.S. Total Market Index, MSCI EAFE Index, and FTSE All-World ex US (ACWI) Index.  If you want an all-US investment, which I'd recommend for the portion of your portfolio that's in stocks (to diversify from total world equity), the best choice by this measure is Vanguard's total US market index fund Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, with .12% fee. Note that Vanguard's flagship S&P 500 index fund Vanguard S&P 500 Index (SPY) has a slightly lower .09% fee, and Vanguard's Total Bond Market index fund Vanguard Total Bond Fund (BIL) has a slightly higher .22% fee. This question contains a recommendation for Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund which tracks Total US Stock market, including the S&P 500. However he doesn't recommend any specific fund. Why not?","The Boglehead way is to invest in low-cost stock and bond index funds, and not to chase performance by investing in high-cost specialty products. It's not that he's ""against"" these specialty products -- it's that they tend to have expensive sales loads and management fees, which eat away at your profit. The result is that investors who choose to track expensive indexes, which have only a few stocks in them, won't outperform those who pick low-cost ETFs.  An advantage of mutual funds and ETFs is that they trade, so they allow you to buy small lots.  You can invest with Vanguard, or Schwab, or just about any financial institution.  That said, I'd recommend against investing in a fund that trades once a week.   You seem to be an active investor, who might benefit from a more active approach to stock picking. Investing only in ETFs allows you to have instant diversification in international markets.  If you need to get a loan in the future to buy a house, they will look at your diversification (meaning how internationally diversified you are). If you're investing in a mutual fund, it's highly likely they'll also be looking at that diversification.   With a world ETF, you own every stock on the planet, and you can get the shares with just a click. So, why bother picking stocks, if all you have to do is click?  That said, there are some people who do want to pick stocks.  For those people, there is also the benefit of owning the shares with that click. For most of us, though, the advantage with a click is less risk.  By owning every single stock, the diversification makes your risk significantly lower.   You can find a world ETF by doing a search for World ETFs."
[INST] Am I considered in debt if I pay a mortgage? [/INST],"Paying on a mortgage means you have ""positive"" debt. You've borrowed money, you're paying it back monthly, reducing the debt each month, and eventually you will finish paying it off. That's good debt. It's even possible that it increases your value rather than reducing it. This seems to be the case for many houses.  So the word ""debt"" is ambiguous. It means quite different things in different sectors of our economy. In general, ""savings"" and ""debt"" are both positive. Negative or ""bad"" debt would be the sort of money you're spending on drugs or gambling and probably not paying back. Some economists argue that there is no reason to pay back debt on an individual level, and that it should instead be managed on a national policy level. It appears to be a personal choice if you wish to pay it off entirely, or just pay it off as fast as you can.",Yes you are in debt! There is a principal amount that is a fixed number and a monthly repayment. A mortgage is just a long term repayment plan. I have a mortgage that I pay each month as set by my financial advisor and the interest is automatically applied which makes it easier for my accountant (me).
[INST] Why does short selling require borrowing? [/INST],"It's worth understanding that a stock share, regardless of whether it's in a bank account or at your broker, must always be registered with the transfer agent for the company whose share you own. When you or your broker want to short sell someone else's shares (and if you're not going to buy back shares from the seller the other way, I think that's what's called ""short sell someone else's shares"") then you have to locate another holder of that stock so that a transfer agent can register ownership, for a fee, with you. Otherwise your share has no identity, you're not the owner, and the stock is not registered to you. That makes the broker and/or you accountable for any dividend lost from that unowned share, and since the stock owner had no dividend and may be annoyed at the loss of money, that's why you have to pay the transfer agent registration fees. If you want to use someone else's shares to short sell, they must give their shares to you for you to short sell, so you owe them for the use of their shares (plus any dividends lost while you're holding it, and any extra fees for your accountancy in tracking that share for them). If you are not going to return those shares, because you are just profiting at the loss that your short selling will bring to the actual owners of the shares, you owe the owner interest on the shares (since you are acting as the banker of those shares) and you owe the owner a percentage of the profit that you received, since it was in part due to the owner's having invested in the original company and being able to lend you their shares to short sell. That's why short selling is expensive, and why it's sometimes called ""selling naked"". It is also why, when an investor actually has more shares than is necessary for the amount of shares that he owns, the extra shares that they have, are often loaned to short sellers by their broker, at commission rates.","For the same reason that you need a bank account to write a cheque: you need there to be another account with the money in, so that you can transfer the money into your own account.  If you want to short stocks A, but the only way you have to do that is by buying them from someone else's account, and not directly from the company whose shares you are selling, you clearly need that person to have actually bought those shares, and thus own them."
"[INST] In the event of a corporate spin-off, how can I calculate the correct cost basis for each company's shares? [/INST]","The spin-offs share are valued according to their fair market value. The FMV is whatever the value of the shares at the time of trading. FMV valuation will vary among corporate financial statements as well as accountants' opinions. That being said, you can value the split according to the FMV at the split. This is easiest if you have records of when the split occurred and the basis of each split share. (It would be unfortunate if you didn't have records, but most likely you do or can easily find them online.) You want the FMV of the spin off stock at the day they were trading. If the spin off stock was traded the day of the split, then you'll simply put that FMV at the time. If not, then you'll have to choose a value. Valuing them as the fair market value the split day would reflect the spin off's value that day as the ""new company"". Any value chosen will not be perfect, and there's a few methods: 1. If the spin off was trading on another stock exchange, then value the spin off's FMV the same. If the spin off doesn't match perfectly in time between you selling the original shares and your receiving the split shares, try to align as close as possible. Some online brokers will have the FMV of both the company you're splitting from and the spin off company. 2. If you have to choose the FMV, choose the FMV of the company you're selling the shares from. It's much more important that this FMV is accurate, and thus the more ""informed decision"" the company had its original value, thus the FMV of the original company is accurate. Once you have the FMV for each share value it accordingly. If you have good records of when and how many from each split, then figuring the cost basis for each would be simple.","When you spin off a company via a stock split or distribution you will receive one share of the new company for each share of stock owned.  No matter what the actual price of the stock is, you would want to keep your cost basis per share the same as when you entered the market. Generally shares will not be trading at time of spin-off (since that would be a pretty major announcement and a lot less subtle than the whole ""we're cutting you this new dividend"" thing).  If you enter the new shares at the same cost and same quantity as your original shares, you should be safe.  The value of your investments should remain constant. There's no reason to pay to receive a letter of stock transfer or anything.  You will own the shares and can sell/trade them as such once the spin off is effective.  If it really bothers you that your ""cost basis"" isn't 100% accurate; you could call the broker and ask for them to do the calculation and assign the new share purchase correctly."
[INST] Financing a vehicle a few months before I expect to apply for a mortgage? [/INST],"If you want to know the effect on your credit score:  the answer is to get a free copy of your current score, and then get one six months after you buy this car. The difference is your score change, from the perspective of someone who runs your score.  (Caution: Most of the companies that report your score won't report your score for 30 days. You could pay for it now, or just check every 30 days.) If you're trying to know the effect on your debt to income ratio:  you'll want to find a mortgage calculator, and plug in the new payments.

[INST] How do I invest in the S&P 500? [/INST],"Well, you can invest in the S&P 500 Index. You can buy the exchange-traded funds (SSP) or get a mutual fund (which has an expense ratio of 0.24%).  However if you are new to investing in the stock market, I feel you may want to first educate yourself at the Motley Fool.","That's a broad question and the answers will inevitably be somewhat opinion-based. It's also unlikely that any one answer will satisfy you completely. A few thoughts, though: There are several low-cost index funds that are available with no minimum investment. That's certainly the fastest way to begin investing. The S&P 500 index includes about 400 stocks. A low-cost index fund will invest in a smaller number of these, representing the main divisions of the index.   A major advantage of index funds, aside from the simplicity and low cost, is that you don't have the potential losses of being invested in individual penny stocks. You can also easily diversify through index mutual funds (Vanguard's VITEX is a low-cost, diversified index fund, for example)."
[INST] Construction loan for new house replacing existing mortgaged house? [/INST],"As a builder, I have helped my clients get construction loans many times over the course of my career. The first thing you need to do is call your bank and discuss the possibilities with them. Your bank will be able to tell you which lenders do this, and often how they prefer to handle them. Construction loans can be difficult because you are essentially funding two loans into one payment stream. Lenders may not accept this, but you just need to keep asking. If you don't like the options given, perhaps you can move your mortgage to another bank (same rate) and they will help you? Some banks will have a 20 year note for construction and will roll that into a 30 year note for the mortgage at the end. It is critical to read the fine print on construction loans. Some will require the construction company to be paid directly, and they hold the money in escrow after a certain percentage of completion. This can be advantageous or disadvantageous depending on whether the builder is honest, you just have to read it (often the lenders will waver if you ask them to waive escrow payments because you already know the builder). When it comes to the mortgage, they will often set it up for a 15 or 20 year term for the first 5 years. For those years you are paying more principal than normal because you have less interest in the payments. At the 5 year mark they will switch you to the 30 year term and you have more P&I in the payments then you would if you had another 5 years on the original term. The downside, is your payments will go up the first 5 years. Some banks will offer a 10 year mortgage for construction, and then move you to a 15 year mortgage which is advantageous if you'll still have your other mortgage. If it helps ease the process talk to the bank first, because they will know if they will switch you to a 15 if they are willing to do a 20 year construction.  You also need to talk to the builder. As a builder, when a customer wants a construction loan, I have an agreement that outlines everything. It outlines the payments, the time lines and what they will have to pay to end it early. Talk to your builder to make sure you have these details covered and don't get robbed! If all else fails, refinance your current home and sell it after the new home is completely finished. If that is the course you are going the build the new house and make it a rental, not a construction loan.  Good luck!","I have no clue what your situation is, but if you were working with a mortgage broker (i.e. your loan is not with a credit union), I'd have some serious issues - namely why don't you have any equity? How many years has this mortgage been in your name? If the equity in your current property is not enough to pay the down payment of 20%, you are essentially living as one of those people who owns a home but cannot afford to pay down the mortgage. If you do not have enough equity to pay the down-payment on the new house, how do you think you can come up with the $120k? Where will the money come from? The bank is not going to lend you money that makes no sense (i.e, paying your current mortgage down $120k and then having your new monthly mortgage payment be too high). Here's a scenario: You owe $175k on your current property, you apply for the loan, the bank sees that you only have $1,200/mo to pay into a loan, and that you have no equity. They are going to ask you to show one of the next two things before they approve the loan:"
[INST] Possible to use balance transfers to avoid interest with major credit cards? [/INST],"I was going to say this was a silly question, but it appears I must explain. The key here is what does ""reimburse"" mean? If you mean the banks will pay interest on the total $0 for 7 months, then just do the math, 8.9% per month is 31% per year.  Therefore, you want to compare the 8.9% (or whatever) to the 31% annual rate in deciding your plan and cost. You want to pay that $3.9k in 7 months at 3.5% ($7/mo) to avoid the 31% annual rate -- even the math tells you it is worth it. However, if you are trying to figure out a long shot plan to avoid 31% for ever, then maybe you can do the math again and see if you can pay those bills in 7 years :-)","You can certainly do this, just watch your rates. Some cards actually have higher rates when you move money and then if you miss any payments for any reason the rates skyrocket. Some cards have a max amount, so pay off the highest first before you get close. I have noticed on the first of the month some of my charges show and then disappear for a few days. I never had the card before so I guess it has to sync with the store for the payment. So I make my minimum payment and then my monthly balance payment. By paying the second early I am not hit with the first monthly charge so I get ahead of the game."
[INST] Indie Software Developers - How do I handle taxes? [/INST],"Your software development income has no basis outside its business purpose or value if for example it doesn't have any income from a real client. Most of time you will be taxed on your income. If you are a contract worker i.e. contractor you would fall under schedule SE to pay self employment taxes. However as an independent contractor you don't know who is going to end up being the real client so you can't really predict how that side of IRS taxing will be. If you use accounting service you might have a problem with your business model not fitting or being in line with their accounting rules. In the end it depends on how you work it. You can always hire a CPA (Certified Public Accountant), EA (Enroll Agent), or an attorney to advise on your particular case on how to proceed with your situation.","You have to pay taxes. The software you developed is your income, and you can only keep part of it. You can either do it yourself, and try to have the knowledge to get it right, or you can have a accountant or business adviser help you with the paperwork. Also, if you are lucky, you have a small business you can use, and use the deductions the IRS allows."
[INST] Different ways of looking at P/E Ratio vs EPS [/INST],"The earnings per share is in essence the value of the net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.  In my example, if the earnings per share (EPS) were lower, I could lower the share price but keep the price earnings ratio as the same, or I could leave the share price on the stock as it is today but increase earnings (e.g., by having an excellent year in 2017) to make a better EPS. These methods can be compared in terms of the ratio that people use most commonly, where the EPS of a stock is divided by a the P/E ratio of the stock. For example, a company could have an excellent year in 2017 and get an earnings per share of $10 whereas last year it got $1.  To keep the PE Ratio the same ($10) the company would need to keep the price of the shares on the stock the same, and since more shares have been created by last year's dividends, the E/P Ratio of this year would be $10, the same as last year. If dividends are important in the valuation by the people who are seeking to invest in the stock's earnings, then increasing earnings per share is preferable.  If dividends to investors are not an issue in the investment value then adjusting the price of shares is a simpler solution to increasing EPS.  To make the company more valuable in this case, a company may look to increase the price of the shares on the stock while keeping the earnings per share the same. Another factor would be the market for shares.  If a lot of people are willing to pay higher prices for shares while there is still some supply then it is easier to increase the price of shares on the stock.  But it may be more challenging/controversial if the supply is limited and people are seeking to buy more shares and the company is trying to sell less shares as opposed to being able to sell more shares in which case the price may need to be cheaper to do so. Lastly, another factor to consider is whether the market is being regulated by a securities commissioner and/or regulator.  For example, if the company is a public corporation that needs to be subject to the regulation of a securities commissioner then adjusting prices and sales is an easier method for keeping ratios the same than other methods, because the securities commissioner would need to determine the ""fair market value"" for how much the shares are publicly traded for on the stock market.  For example the shares of Tesla were once not so expensive. Since then it has become more expensive, but at the same time people are willing to pay more for them.  If the price of an automotive company's shares was too high Tesla's securities' commissioner would probably regulate a price lower and/or a ratio lower or else the shares would no longer be publicly traded with the current market price.","It appears that the EPS quoted on the page is actually for the fiscal 2014 YEAR, not the previous year.  To get the EPS for Y2013, you'll have to find the last quarter's EPS for DD:EPS by itself. This is why the PEG ratio appears low. The last quarter's PEG is very high. The PEG as a ratio of EPS, not P/E, has been dropping since July. This is to be expected. Forward PEG on October 3rd was almost 30, and is now under 20."
[INST] Withholding for unexpected Short-Term Capital Gains and Penalties [/INST],You may want to try looking through previous year's tax books. If they got it wrong last year would that fix your problem?,"You should also realize that your tax liability from your capital gains will increase, which will further increase your tax withheld on non-employment income (capital gains are taxed at lower rates, so the amount withheld is the same, even though the final tax may be at a higher rate)."
[INST] Implied or historical volatility to calculate theoretical options price with black scholes? [/INST],"The option is a European call option.  The question is about calculating an option price given some inputs like a time of maturity (time until expiry), an implied volatility, a riskfree rate, and a stock price -- i.e. how to calculate a price at some other time given those inputs. Option prices in real life can be estimated using the market; when in doubt, just look at the market price at one point in time and one point in the future.  When calculating the price at the time you want to view is up to the user of the Black-Scholes formulas.  Usually what people want to do is look backwards.  So we start with the option's current fair price.  We don't know the price of the stock, only what the current price is assumed to be.   Next, we use known volatility and known fair price to calculate the standard deviation for the future price of the stock, in a way that allows us to use the normal distribution.  Note: the normal distribution is only an ""excellent estimator"" of how prices might change in practice.  It's not perfect; stock prices don't necessarily follow the normal distribution.  But often the error in the approximation is negligible.  Note also: the option is traded in an efficient market, where the option's price and volatility should reflect the information.  If the option's implied volatility and market price are not in perfect agreement, then the market doesn't trust one or the other's calculation.  Sometimes in practice the market price and ""implied"" volatility are inconsistent. These are the inputs to the Black Scholes option pricing formula, so it's possible to calculate the option price at another time.  If the Black-Scholes formula matches the implied volatility, then the market will converge on that number.  If it doesn't, then the market's ""fair"" price and the volatility have some information that isn't being used by the Black Scholes formula's input.  This means that Black-Scholes should be considered a theoretical estimate at best.","It just so happens that the Wikipedia page on the Black-Scholes equations has this handy little table on the effects of the variable inputs on the resulting price of the option: In the table, you can see that a doubling of the volatility of the stock results in a four-times increase in theoretical option price. Thus, a $1000 investment in the stock with the same parameters as your example - except for $10 volatility on the stock - would be worth $3.52 (25 volatility) and would have an option price of $7.81. This is compared to an original option price for the $10 volatility option of  $1.99.  I'm not sure why you expect the option to be worth $4.01 if you used Black-Scholes. Here what Wikipedia has to say about the model: The model assumes the option to be priced in an efficient market on a ""no-arbitrage"" basis, and that the underlying asset price follows an approximate lognormal distribution where  The volatility of the underlying stock price is assumed to be constant, or equivalently, geometric Brownian motion. Also, the option price P(S, K, 0, T) is assumed to vary with a log-log relationship with the price of the underlying stock, or equivalently, with geometric Brownian motion. With these assumptions, the option price is a function of the stock price S, the strike price K, the time to expiry T, and the risk-free interest rate r (measured as a function of time until expiry). This means that the relationship between the value of the option and the other components of the equation is pretty complicated. If you wish to see all the math that goes into the relationship, Wikipedia has again been super helpful with the following derivation of the actual Black-Scholes equation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes While I have been doing some additional research on this and I may have more information for you tomorrow, I hope this helps!"
[INST] How do I bring money overseas? [/INST],"First of all don't do this.  Don't bring large quantities of money in and out of countries.  You are asking for trouble.    That being said, you need to have good documentation and be willing to answer every question the customs agent asks.  You will have to justify why you have large amounts.  One thing to keep in mind is the dollar limits set by customs and the banks.  Anything under $US 10,000 is considered currency.  Anything over that is considered capital, so you will have to fill out the necessary paperwork and show that the money was earned legally via legitimate business means.   Now, there are countries that have very strict laws regarding money, and if you are caught with money that could be considered ill gotten gains, you could be in big trouble.  You also do not want to look arousing to money launderers, tax evaders, and other criminal types who will want to take the money from you by force.  They could hold you hostage or harm you and your family.","You don't bring the money because it doesn't sound like you have any use case for it.  When you get the money to you, you're just going to lose it to local currency exchange rate changes on exchange, currency conversion fees, and probably local taxes. Why not send your money by Western Union instead? Most banks will exchange money and will not allow cash to be transferred from one country to another.  If you get lucky, they will, but even then you will still be charged exchange fees, local taxes from the country where it is issued, and local taxes in the host country."
[INST] Should I pay off my car loan within the year? [/INST],"If you are going to own your home and are planning on getting a 20% down payment, your DTI should not include any car payments.  You need to get rid of the car loan to be approved for the mortgage.","To paraphrase Mr Miyagi, ""sensei, you no understand.  Cars don't get into your heart, they get into your pocket."" In other words, your car is only valuable as long as it works, and every moment you own it your vehicle is getting older/worse (and that will mean it'll be worth less when you finally get rid of it). At this point in time, the value of keeping that loan on your report (for a time) is small compared to the depreciation on your vehicle. (As you note, loans can stay on your report for many years, but they have an expiration date.)"
[INST] Smart to buy a house in college? [/INST],"It is possible to have a very successful property investment business that you can take into the future if you do it correctly and the right circumstances arise.  I would not, however, recommend buying property as a rental in town near your college.  There are two main problems you will face when considering that type of investment: For example, I know someone who tried to rent a nice house to students for cheap rates to make friends.  He ran into a series of problems after each tenant moved out.  He had a small leak from the attic that went undetected for a full year with no moisture detector because the renters couldn't see it, the tenant painted one room and used a paint with a mildew inhibitor in it (because his ceiling leaked above that room) that damaged the paint on 4 other walls, and the tenant threw a keg party that resulted in beer spilled all over the floor, walls, and ceiling. When it came time to replace the carpeting, the renters couldn't reach the carpet cleaner to the corners so that left permanent stains in the carpet.  If any of this damage had been identified early enough, the property owner could have charged the renters for the damage through a lawyer and had a case against them.  However, with three months between renters, it was essentially impossible to get the appropriate money out of the renters.  Since this property owner has zero experience in managing rental property, he ended up losing a lot of time, money, and sanity going after the renters, and he lost several months of potential profit from having the property empty and not generating any income.  He also had a really low rent that made it difficult getting a positive cash flow from the property and it created an expectation among potential residents that it was going to be cheap.  It wasn't until the property he built for himself was complete that he was able to realize higher cash flow, but that property was so much larger that it required more renters while still staying only 13% of the size of the property he was renting out.  You can certainly find an investment property in town, but it will take a lot of experience.","If you're going to buy a house anyway, great.  That means you're planning on staying in the area, have some means to make a down payment, and pay for closing costs.  The best mortgage loan is the one you can afford.   If you are renting, is there a specific reason, other than the mortgage tax deduction, you are not buying a $100,000 condo in a college town?  A decent sized 1 bedroom condo in a college town.  One where the rents are $1500 or more per month.    Many college towns have a lot of apartments in older buildings.   Is that really a good place to store 50k+ in cash and/or assets?    It doesn't take long to make that back up.  Most of my peers I went through school with already had a condo or home.  We just picked ones that were in our budget, or started with our parents down payment, and a lower mortgage, to put ourselves in a position where they would grow with us.   What I find interesting in your story is that you have $50,000 saved, on a salary of $925.  That makes me question how you are budgeting if you have that much savings.  It also makes me think that you can't afford even a $16,000 mortgage. A small home in a college town may not need an alarm system.  If you are on a quiet road (or have a dead end road), with a small property, it would be pretty hard to break into your place.  Many homes in college towns already have alarm systems, and in my own situation, the condo I rented already had an alarm.   But in some cases a small home or condo is a good choice.  The value of a home goes up, and with rising rents, a condo you own could cash flow, for an investment home.  It also gives you a sense of stability, as your rent never really goes down.   As long as you have the income you may get more enjoyment out of having a place to relax at.  Especially when you don't travel.  You may also have a hard time with that rental agreement with no long lease."
[INST] What are my risks of early assignment? [/INST],"Your risk is in the price of the short stock - if at any time the price increases above the strike price of your puts, your puts could get called in.  Typically, calls on the stock are far more likely to be called in than puts. The time value or the intrinsic value of your options will play a role along with the stock price.  In general, if stock prices have already made a significant move (up or down), early assignment will be more of a risk because there is more time value in the options, as well as more time for the stock price to make another significant move up or down.  At times like this, you are more likely to need to post additional margin if you are short the stock.  If stock prices are trading close to the strike price, or have made a significant move lower, the downside to your puts is that they will likely expire worthless.","As a general principle: you're only at risk of early assignment if it's in the money right now, because the exercise price is below the market price. Once the market price is below the exercise price, you're safe as the market value is less than the value they could get by exercising the options. A better understanding of that point is given in this question: Would I be more likely to be subject to early assignment if I purchase more shares to push my delta closer to 1? You still run the risk that the value of your shares will continue to fall until this premium falls below their strike price, at which time you will likely get exercised on. The way to understand this is that the longer you own an option, and the more time that passes the more likely it's going to fall into the money as time passes. If that happens, then you're going to run the risk of early assignment."
[INST] Is it common in the US not to pay medical bills? [/INST],"Credit card payments are due in full within a month or so.  It's a loan that will be reported as such on your credit, and failure to pay on time will be reported also.  Medical bills have a longer grace period in order to give flexibility to people that really are not paying.  The reason medical bills are an issue at the moment (and medical bankruptcy is so common) is that many people don't pay them, and it is common practice for the medical billing agencies to report to credit agencies, and this does have a negative effect on people's credit.  It's not an intentional act. The medical billing clerks are just doing their jobs.  They see a bill that went unpaid.  So they record it on the debtor's record.  This means the medical bill may not actually be delinquent, just that no payment was made in 3, 4, or 6 months.  So it's not a fraud case.  The medical bill really did come in, but the recipient has not been paying it.  It's important also to understand that it's common practice for medical billing agencies to sell medical bills they still believe are valid to ""for-profit debt collectors"" as a way to reduce the amount of delinquent accounts clogging their office space and accounting overhead (like the credit card companies do with collections).  They expect debtors to pay the biller or debt collector, to resolve it, but, in the case of a person that is ill, that could be exactly the person you do not want contacting you and trying to sell you on their plan, etc. so that you don't pay the original biller.  So there is a lot going on at various levels and for various purposes. What's critical here is that the actual amount being claimed on the debt in question and who is claiming it needs to be understood. While it's true that credit cards are an unsecured loan, since there is no collateral attached to the debt, and they are also secured in another way, it is a case of ""credit-worthiness,"" i.e. whether the person is likely to repay the obligation.  While the credit card company will send out a letter stating that this is what they think at the time of the loan, if for some reason they think the person is likely to pay back the debt, they can choose to call the loan.  The person may repay the debt, but the obligation will still be on report with the credit agencies.  If there are 60 days between payments, it's not fraud; it's a late bill payment. Whereas a medical billing agency is not going to issue a late payment as a late payment. They're going to do that as a debt.  They may even have a cut-off period for when a ""debt"" is sold to a ""debt collector.""  And, if, in fact, the debt has been sold, it's not the billing agent that you owe.  It's the debt collector that you owe.  And the details of that debt (who are the original biller, the debt collector, and who issued the debt to the collector) are not being reported in the debtor's report but in the original biller's (or biller's agent's) report. So, the best solution is to track the originator of the debt from the collector until you see the original debt and debtor being reported back to the debtor's credit report and to see how late the debt is and to pay the debt in full; otherwise, your credit is taking a hit because you're not paying a debt because you're not making payments, because you're not paying. It's important to understand that the medical provider is only a conduit.  They issued the debt as a medical bill, but they, themselves, may not have received payment. It's common for the medical provider's accounting department to not receive any payments, so that the medical provider's revenue department has no data to report on accounts receivable nor any record to report on a debtor's account.  So the medical provider did their job; they issued the debt as a medical bill.  They just haven't received any payment, so it's the debt collector you need to be paying, because it's the debt collector that's reporting to the credit agencies. And this is critical because if you look at the debt that's on your report, there are some that are in the 350 - 450 day window of being removed, so that","I am in the United States, and I personally have never been charged an unpaid medical bill. But I have seen others who have paid bills from other sources. I was curious as to why this happens, since the United States does not have any universal healthcare for a good number of its citizens. I was told by more than one person that the person who is charged would be charged a debt to collection if they received an unpaid bill, so paying it now keeps your credit good, but if you fail to pay it the debt gets passed to collection and it will remain on your credit for 7 years. I have read articles that say this isn't true, but those articles are a few years old and I haven't heard anyone else deny this. What I would suggest is to write your creditors and request their contact information for the person that would be billed, this person is generally only named on bills like that and I know that if I wrote a letter asking for their number I would get a response back to me in a few days to provide me with the information."
[INST] Owner-Financed home sale or Land Contract — how to handle the transaction and the ongoing entity? [/INST],"Congratulations on finding a win win deal.  You have a motivated seller and a motivated buyer.  Your biggest obstacles will be seller financing, which might scare off your buyer and the ongoing legal entity.  I would suggest handling the seller financing like any other loan.  Collect your payments, send the money to the bank.  You should not use your personal funds or other personal accounts to finance a property you own.  Once the buyer makes the payments and the funds are in a separate account, I would then distribute the funds (principal + interest) to yourself and the seller for income.  From your description of owning an LLC, I would suggest doing something similar for the ongoing legal entity.  The entity should pay you a fair salary, but should keep an equity stake, in case you want to grow the company in the future.  The profitability of the separate entity should probably be reported to you as you are taking risks. If you get the deal structure wrong, your buyer could end up owing you money, in which case you may have trouble collecting from them.  Or you could end up losing money if you are paying interest on the principal of payments, but those are not tax deductible.  I would suggest you look for a legal professional to advise you and handle this deal (with your direction of course).   Be careful of creating a tax problem by buying a condo if that's really what you are getting into.  You may be better off as an LLC.  If you do get an LLC, consider filing as a pass through entity (S-Corp or LLC) so you can still deduct your income and expenses from your profits for tax purposes.","I'm not sure this was addressed above, but what if this is a ""rent-to-own"" agreement rather than a ""seller financing?""  If that is the case, there are additional issues at play, particularly on the tax front.  There is special tax treatment for ""qualified residential transactions"" where the buyer does indeed intend to rent the property to the seller during ownership and pay the seller off over time using rental payments.  In this case, assuming all the proper paperwork is completed, the seller should not need to worry about tax withholdings.  If, however, the intention is that the buyer will not rent to the seller, or if the property deed has not been recorded (which must happen for the seller to be considered a ""qualified purchaser""), or if the seller is not using a 3rd-party (bank or other financial institution) to ""hold the payments"" the transaction most likely will fall under the traditional tax regime for mortgages, where the seller is required to collect and withhold state and federal taxes from each payment made. The mortgage broker in my area handles a lot of seller financing transactions, including rent-to-own.  Their standard operating procedure is for the buyer's mortgage to cover less than 80% of the purchase price.  This means some other entity (buyer, the seller, a 3rd party, possibly both the buyer and seller) is holding a 20% equity position.  So it seems that you're the owner of at least 20% of some entity that holds 20% in the property.  This is why I'd go back to the broker to find out what is happening with your equity.  How much are you out of pocket?  How are you owning something if you know you don't really have any ""sweat equity"" in the place.  What was the 20% used for?  Was it used to pay interest-only loans?  Were the payments made to you from the broker, the buyer?  Was the property even deeded to the buyer?  If the deed was recorded (and the deed was recorded in the seller's name), it sounds like whoever owns the house may have a serious legal situation on their hands. If someone can help us understand what is really happening, it's possible we could suggest a simpler and clearer arrangement than a trust."
[INST] How long do wire transfers take? [/INST],"If it is a SWIFT wire transfer, then it depends on where you send it from and where you are sending it to. For example, the Federal Reserve Banks in the USA used to guarantee that your wire or ACH payment would be on the receiving bank's account as early as 3pm the next business day.  These guarantees have since been suspended, so now for example wire transfers sent to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York may still get there the next business day, but it is now dependent ""upon the receipt time, cutoff time, and other processing routines of the receiving financial institution.""  Some wire transfers take 3 or 5 business days.  Most are somewhere in between.","This will vary slightly from bank to bank, but generally a domestic transfer of funds to another bank account can take less than a business day to be available to the other person. Some banks will hold it for longer and make it available on the next business day. The longer that your transfer will take will depend on the country where the beneficiary is in. This may mean the beneficiary's own bank, and sometimes the bank your transfer is coming from will be able to tell you the expected time of delivery. International transfers between countries may take anywhere between 2 to 5 business days. Transfers to certain countries may take longer than others depending on the bank, and in some cases transfers are not available at all to certain countries. If your transfer is to or from the UK then if the beneficiary's bank is UK based and your bank in Italy is part of the Faster Payments Service in the UK (your bank will have to be in the list of participating banks and building societies). You could use a Faster Payments Service from your bank's online banking service, or if you have the beneficiary's account details, from your bank's mobile banking app. These generally take 2 hours to clear into the beneficiary's account. When sending funds to foreign countries, always call your bank to ask for an estimated time of delivery. If the time your bank can give you is not acceptable, find a bank that can meet your needs. Some banks will also offer next day or even instant money transfers. If it is not instant, then it may also have a cut-off time for it to reach the other account on the next business day (for instance some banks will only let you do a same day transfer if the transfer is made before 1 pm local time to their bank)."
[INST] What is this type of risk-free investment called? [/INST],It's called Principal Protected Notes.,"A TIPS is a Treasury Inflation-Protected Security issued by the US Department of Treasury. They're similar to Treasuries but they're linked to CPI-U. The difference between TIPS and regular Treasuries is, basically, that the principal amount increases in proportion to the US Consumer Price Index. That is, if you have an annual principal of $500 and CPI-U increased 212% during the period the principal increases by that same amount, to $1,022. So it's a different instrument.   One of the downsides of TIPS is that they're very illiquid. The bid-ask is wider than Treasuries because of this. But that's only one source of information about TIPS."
[INST] Why does financial investor bother to buy derivatives and then hedge the position? [/INST],Why does an investor want to hedge the investment? The derivatives market's primary goal is to help eliminate risks in an investment portfolio. Why else would you buy insurance? Why buy credit default swaps when you can sell corporate bonds? Well the corporate bond (if properly priced) doesn't leave you at risk if a company defaults on its obligation. The company is rated. The ratings are updated and the bonds are (roughly) valued accordingly. If you own a company's debt and they default then you own junk bonds. That's a guaranteed loss (until the company files bankruptcy). This doesn't leave you at unnecessary risk. Why else might an investor purchase insurance? Why would they needlessly expose themselves to unnecessary risk? Because derivatives also take a cut of the return on the value of the asset they were meant to guard. If you needlessly purchase insurance you are also paying an unnecessary fee. There is nothing wrong with purchasing insurance when you need it. Some situations merit this and some situations do not. Some investments are risky and sometimes it makes good sense to eliminate the risk if the cost is a reasonable price. So there you go. That is why. Why would a money manager pay a lot for a low-yield CD? Why would they want guaranteed losses? Because low-yield CDs are a way for money managers to limit their risk by eliminating their exposure while still accepting returns. This allows money managers to hedge their investments. It is done to preserve capital in order to keep investing money. Why else would you take a huge loss (by selling an asset at a big negative return) and still accept the gains if you are concerned about the value of said investment? You would not do this. This is exactly what would happen and why this is what is happening in the U.S. today.,"When you use a derivative, you're putting more time and effort out of it for an attempt to 'beat the market' and get a better return.  The option premium is something you're paying for that chance; that is the hedging cost.  If the odds are good enough, they might be willing to take it.  In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been considering some rule changes that would permit institutions to make these kinds of trades without public disclosure, so the costs wouldn't be apparent. It's worth remembering that for an individual investor, if you see it, so does your competition, and that's a cost in itself."
[INST] Car dealers offering lower prices when financing a used car [/INST],"Financing is how the dealership gets paid. What people tend to forget when shopping for cars is that financing an already inflated price is the dealerships goal.  So really to get the deal of the deal you would really need to finance a car under the Bluebook value or what Carmax will buy the car for.  So, yes paying in cash will always be the cheapest option. But the real question is how comfortable are you with what could result in the dealers lack of financing the deal.","It appears that you have two major issues. These are not mutually exclusive. I would suggest that the finance deal is the primary concern - in that it is not the car dealer, but the lender, who is providing the finance.  Dealerships can negotiate terms based on the information they have about you, and your car - but they don't have the same information as the lender, so it's very hard for them to offer you the same terms and pricing.  In addition, you are in a strong position to negotiate the price of the vehicle. Since you plan to sell the car back if it gets too costly, it is reasonable for you to negotiate hard on purchase price - but not so hard that the finance company isn't able to provide a loan on the terms you desire (for example, lower rates and lower payments).  From what you're discussing I imagine that you are still in a strong enough position to negotiate the initial price down, and to perhaps find a different lender as well. From what you've said, I don't believe the price of $125/month is in line with either the MSRP or the KBB Trade-In value, so I think that you have some room.  While you may not be able to bring it down to $85/month, I suspect you can be closer to that level. Once you establish a price you're willing to pay, and secure financing, or even apply for financing, I think you'll see that the next step, making the purchase, is easy."
"[INST] Why does a stock's price fluctuate so often, even when fresh news isn't available? [/INST]","To add to what is already an amazing post from @mbhunter... As well as the fundamentals of a company, supply and demand also affects the price of a stock. The volume available on the market will affect the bid/ask prices. If large volume is present, buyers will be able to purchase a large amount of stock near the ask price. While there was no news from company, a large volume of buying will result in an increase in price. The same concept can be seen in a decrease in price.","An important component of a modern stock market is a continuous auction or ""quote drive"" that maintains the price on the stock and allows trades to happen at whatever price people have bid at - more or less. Some parts of this are very well documented, but when you say there are no new announcements being made you are glossing over that fact that the entire market continuously and automatically makes these sorts of updates. When you talk about ""fluctuations"" you should really be discussing the price distribution so that you see that the fluctuations are not as wide as people assume. It's common for the price to get bids in at a higher price and asks in at a lower price, but it's unusual for those price gaps to be large enough to create a lot of ""noise"" when they are filled.  The bid-ask distribution is something that is well documented mathematically in the academic setting, but is only just starting to be understood in terms of real world data."
[INST] What is Chit funds. And how to invest in it? [/INST],"chit funds are a form of forced savings. Chit fund investors meet at some regular time intervals, usually once a month. When there is new member then that person has to pay an additional amount than the members who have joined earlier. Say one person will have to pay amount X if the person is the first one to join the chit fund, then the other person will have to pay X + amount more than X and so on. On joining, one gets a coupon in denomination of the amount he or she has paid. The coupons are then put into a pot. Then one coupon is randomly selected from the pot by some chosen person. The person carrying the coupon gets the complete amount in the pot. All other coupons are discarded. If there are 4 persons A, B, C, D, A gets a coupon with denomination X, B gets a coupon with denomination X+.2 of X. C gets a coupon with denomination X +. 4 of X and D gets a coupon with denomination X+. 6 of X. Say after 2 months B's coupon gets picked, then B gets X + 2 of X. In this way, one person is able to accumulate more money. Chit fund are unregulated. The person, who conducts the meeting can take your money. Also there is a chance that your coupon will never be picked, in which case all the money that you have paid will go the others. So make sure that you use your head before joining a chit fund.","Chit Fund is like insurance between family and friends or co-workers.  Typically, the members of the group would pool in same or different amounts of money monthly, based on the total group amount decided. On a cyclic period like 12 months or less, the person holding that month's money would take the money he/she needs to make the payment or pay the fees of the recipient to collect the money. This helps in many ways, for instance your 5 friends need $100 every cycle. If the group total pooled amount is $500, 1 friend would get the whole $100 for that cycle. In this way people get the money they need each cycle. This is also helpful for people who usually would need money on the spot and pay the loan fees for the money, whereas this money could be used to take care of the money you need. But like in every group, there are people who would try to take advantage of the pool, so it's just like insurance wherein you have to have a lot of trust in the group since people would want to earn more than the usual pool amount by taking advantage of the insurance. There's also another setup where the cyclic amount would be determined by dividing the group amount you pooled by the cycle you chose to payout, like instead of paying $500 monthly for 1 payment each cycle, we could pay $200 every month for 2 payments each cycle. In this case you will get $5 if the cycle is 12 months."
"[INST] Credit card grace period for pay, wait 1 day, charge? [/INST]","5 - 6 days. For starters, you could use that week to review your bills and start paying down whatever extra debt you have.  Also, you could take that week to do something you've been procrastinating, call up a doctor's office for a test that you've been postponing,  make a donation to charity that you've been meaning to for a while. Just like anything else in life, you'll probably get off the band wagon a few times.  That shouldn't stop you from trying.   Good luck, and I hope you stick with it.","You cannot rely on the grace period for your purchases. It's not your choice whether the bank provides a grace period. It's theirs. You should be able to locate the terms and conditions of the card you carry. Otherwise give them a call; they should be easy to find.

[INST] How much money are you actually trading with options? [/INST],"There is no minimum amount required for trading in an option as opposed to shares. You can literally buy or sell 1 share, 1 call or sell 1 contract on the underlying asset the option represents. It's also not true most options are ""tied"" to 100 shares.  Options can be traded on multiple exchanges, and depending on the exchange some options are only sold in lots, as small as 100 shares or as large as 1,000 or more. There are many ways in which brokers handle small lot orders by allowing trading in 1, 2, 3 or 4 contracts on that underlying asset.","No.  You don't actually exchange money for a call option until you exercise the option.  But you still need the money to exercise the option.  You're not out until then.   If you own an option a certain amount of time before expiration, it's time value is high.  However the more time passes, the more time value is less.   And so a seller of a call option might have a different expiration date for the option.  The two of you still have no money exchanged until you exercise.   And of course both buyer and seller can change their mind prior to expiring and exercise or sell the option before then."
[INST] Beginner questions about stock market [/INST],"(a) Your broker should be providing you with the ""real time"" price data, and it's usually the best (least delay) you can get.  However, the difference between different brokers (especially different countries) can vary considerably. Some will have more and better databases (the company that trades in one stock market may be completely different from trades in another stock market).  Some will have more and better computer processing power, and data transfer facilities.  If your broker is only providing you with the ""real time"" data from one (or a small group) stock market, then it should have been in the fineprint somewhere, though it will vary from country to country what has to be in your contract. (b) If you go for ""real time"" for all quotes from all trades, some of the delays you suffer as a result of this:","The biggest reason why investing in the stock market has been a good choice in the last 20 years is that in that period we had no major financial crisis. In fact many analysts were predicting financial crisis after financial crisis but each time when the bubble was due to pop it didn't. We have never had a global slow-down but rather a global boom. The problem is that while the stock market goes up continuously that is not a guarantee that it will keep on rising or that your investments will go up. There's no way to tell for sure and there's no guarantee. What does look pretty safe though is that in the long term the global economy has been growing (and this has lead to greater productivity which leads to bigger companies, greater demand for goods and services which then means higher wages, a strong global economy etc) and this is the main reason why even those who try to get out when the stocks are high have to go back in when prices are much lower. In 20 years who knows what will have happened? Perhaps financial crises will be commonplace and the economy will be slowing down everywhere and stock prices will be dropping faster and faster. Or maybe technology will just take off to such an extent that demand for goods and services will be overwhelmingly high which will be great because companies will be growing continuously and their stock prices will be reaching record highs! A few things to consider though - How safe are you with the stock market? We may be on a lucky streak but luck has to continue forever. Also while the market may be going up now you can't expect it to keep going up forever. You should not treat the stock market as a safe haven. It's not. It's volatile and very likely to go up and down at certain time periods. At any moment, you should be prepared to lose your entire stake. Is your money in the stock market invested in a way that benefits you or a company executive? There are many studies which have demonstrated that the performance of stock traders in the stock market do not beat a randomly chosen index (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_portfolio_management#Performance). This is mainly due to the fact that there is a huge demand for their services. A lot of people believe that individual traders can beat the market and they keep on paying for advice and these people then use that money to invest further which boosts the market prices further. So it's very important that you do some research to figure out your strategy. Are you ready for the stock market in general to fall a lot? If the stock market drops 5, 10, 20% what do you do? If this happens (and again there's no guarantee that any amount of money will be lost forever) do you just sit and hope your investment goes back up? Or do you get to work and try to figure out how to increase your investment?"
[INST] What are the pros and cons of investing in a closed-end fund? [/INST],"There are two main advantages to closed-end mutual funds over open-end funds: There are no redemptions. If the fund managers see a drop in the market, or some other negative situation, they are free to sell out of positions whenever they want. This means that they can sell the stocks or other investments whenever the best time is, rather than being forced to sell everything today and hope the market recovers in two days. In other words, closed-end funds are allowed to have higher average positions than open-end funds. No daily sales fees. The sales fee is the management fee an investor pays to be in the investment. This is typically 1-2% per year. If a fund had an investor redemption each day, they would have to pay the sales fee each time an investor left the fund. With closed-end funds, the fund managers are able to invest the initial funds received, and then re-invest the proceeds from leaving investors. So if the fund manager has $1,000 per share, they are able to put some of that $1,000 in the share price, and some of it towards actually purchasing investments, making them potentially able to purchase investments at a lower price than other investors (assuming someone else is selling shares on a given day). This gives them a better chance of beating the market, as long as they are diligent at managing the fund, and buying and selling the right things at the right time. No daily redemptions also means that a closed-end fund can be listed on the stock exchange, whereas an open-end fund cannot. Closed-end mutual funds are able to pay dividends on their underlying investments, while open-end funds traditionally have to reinvest the earnings from the investments and give back in a form other than cash to the investor. However, because open-end mutual funds have no way to actually reduce their outstanding units, they cannot continue their redemptions if redemptions occur more frequently than their underlying investments can make dividends. Closed-end funds are still somewhat susceptible to investor's wanting to leave the fund, and therefore closing it (since there is not always enough people wanting the shares being sold).","While the information provided by @bob is good - and complete - I want to add some to it. There are only really two reasons why a closed end fund is better than an exchange traded fund: Taxation.  The CEFs don't need to continuously sell shares to meet redemption requests, but can instead meet these requests by re-investing in shares of the underlying stocks.  The company will need to pay out dividends on the remaining shares, so they are effectively lowering the payout ratio (the dividend paid out as a percentage of the shares issued).  It is this difference that ultimately makes the CEF a better choice from a tax perspective.  The difference between this method of returning capital to shareholders and an ETF, which is effectively forced to always turn over shares to meet redemptions.  As a result, the ETF is taxed much more heavily.  The difference between a CEF and an ETF can be seen in the fund holdings, where an ETF will be continually buying in more shares of its constituent stocks and selling to redeem.   You need to be careful though.  Because the difference in treatment is largely a tax-related difference, it is possible that the CEF will issue more shares at times to meet higher than usual redemptions.  When this occurs - while generally not frequent with most CEFs - the ETF will be the more tax efficient choice for this short period.  If you hold an ETF, you will get dividends and capital gains in the usual ways, and if the share holdings fluctuate wildly during this period, the value of the ETF might jump up much higher, making for an easy choice.  But in general, the CEF tax treatment is the primary reason to seek it out, particularly in your situation. If the fund is closed, then generally, that is just a measure to prevent the situation I mention above from really causing the fund value to rise significantly, or make rebuilding the ETF a challenge.  But you should look at its price to value ratio and its dividend yield, if you're concerned.  If the fund is undervalued or has an unusually high yield, that is probably a strong indication you're on the right track.  If they are at reasonable metrics in that department, then either way will suit you well."
[INST] Do individual stocks have futures trading [/INST],"No.  However, options that give the holder the right to buy a share of stock are a derivative:","Yes, there are (see below), but some are very different to equity futures. For example, the VIX, which is the 'fear' index, is a future on volatility, not on an underlying equity. Also, ETF futures were introduced in 2008. One example is the E-Min SPDR S&P500 ETF future which matures in December 2011, traded on the CME. Also, there are 'forward' agreements on futures contracts (the FF contract), which trade on exchanges. These have an additional settlement point, the 'Futures Fixing', which is a contract on the futures contract itself. There are many different types of futures contract, which may also include various options. For example, the Euro STOXX (stock options), which was introduced by Goldman Sachs in 1984.  Also, there are options on options, where option on an option is settled by exercise or settlement. And, as a separate, different entity from the future contracts themselves, an option on a future can also be settled by delivery or settlement.  Then there are options on the underlying security itself, which may be different to the futures."
[INST] Why would we need a “stop-limit order” for selling? [/INST],"When you wish to sell an existing share, especially when that share is held in your margin account at a loss, the broker will often offer you an opportunity to cancel the order as soon as it is processed. This is offered both as a courtesy in case the market has moved significantly (and the share would be executed at an even greater loss), and as a safety valve in case you accidentally enter two conflicting orders via multiple web/telephone/app sessions (for instance, if you had entered in an order for buy but now feel that your market outlook is incorrect and instead wish to sell what you had hoped to buy). Since this can take a minute or two to complete, you may not realize that the sell order (or possibly the cancel of the sell order) wasn't placed, and find yourself inadvertently going short in a manner you didn't anticipate. Note that other brokers do NOT allow you to cancel the execution of the order once it's been fully processed, although I haven't checked this with all margin brokers. The stop-limit order avoids this problem (since once any loss exceeding the specified limit is reached the order is canceled), but can incur a different set of risks if used carelessly.","As a followup to your question, limit orders can be used for buying shares as well as selling them.  Just as you'd want to get the highest possible price in a sell order, you'd also want the lowest possible price in a buy order.  A limit order is the maximum you'll accept for a sell and the minimum you'll accept for a buy.  This doesn't guarantee the price at which you'll get in or out, but it does guarantee that your transaction will happen at this price or better."
[INST] Why should we expect stocks to go up in the long term? [/INST],The long term price of a stock is theoretically impossible to predict based on information that is available at present. This is true even with an efficient market. It is possible for stocks to have long term price trends if they are mispriced by people currently on the market.,"This is based on the concept of free markets: In a free market, there are no government laws and rules controlling the price of goods. There are no subsidies, tariffs, quotas, regulations or restrictions that would influence any price. It can also be assumed that there are no external environmental influences that would affect the price. It follows that if a free market is a functioning entity, it means that the goods produced in that market are priced at the amount determined by buyers and sellers interacting: supply and demand. If all factors remain the same with regards to supply and demand of both companies and goods, and no outside forces influence the price, then we can expect that the price will remain relatively constant. One can also assume that this applies to a stock market, therefore if all factors remain constant, and a market is functioning, then one can assume that the price of stocks will remain constant. Now if someone decides to buy or sell a stock, either because they believe the price will increase or decrease (whether it does so or not), they are making the decision themselves based on supply and demand at that time. If, for example, they believe the price will increase in the future, due to factors such as increased sales, profit margins, or better management decisions, then it is rational to increase the demand. Therefore, to simplify the example, we can say that they are essentially taking the future value of the price of a company and dividing it by the present value to find today's price. In summary: If an individual believes that a stock will go up in the future, they are doing so based on supply and demand in the present. If the majority of individuals believe this, then it will lead to an increase in the demand for that stock, and it will reflect in its price on the stock market. And this is the premise for why there is an expectation that stocks will go up in the long-term: because there are rational individuals at play in a free market."
[INST] Townhouse or stand-alone house for a first home? [/INST],"Congrats on getting pre-approved! The mortgage lending process has improved over the last few years and is much more competitive.  I would suggest you take to heart the comments of others regarding your down payment.   I disagree with those who suggest buying a rental.  The cost of rental property is the cost of the mortgage plus ongoing repairs/maintenance and property taxes plus the cost of owning (i.e. the mortgage tax deduction, not that the tax savings necessarily matters to you if you fall into the 10% bracket.)  Buying a townhouse that is part of an HOA doesn't usually have any restrictions on renting the property.","If you are looking for a long term investment, a townhouse will most likely provide better financial return. The fact that the house is smaller provides less opportunity for unexpected major expenses which can have a bigger impact on your financial well being.  However, I think you should consider a different question first - which one will make you happier?"
[INST] Are solar cell panels and wind mills worth the money? [/INST],"Renewable Energy is here to stay, if not for the cost and environmental benefits, it is a proven fact that fossil fuels are going to be used up eventually, and will get more expensive to mine out of the ground. Renewable Energy is a wise investment.  If you can save some money on utility bills, and help the planet in the process, that's a win-win situation.  Solar panels and wind turbines are not magic technology, they are pretty much what they seem to be.  There are some great resources out there that help compare different solar panel and wind turbine setups, and show you the potential savings.  Here's a good place to start: http://www.energysage.com/solar/systems/","Most solar panels are very expensive.  The current cost of the panels alone is more than 80% of the cost of a solar energy system.  If you can install the panels yourself then you still need to invest in the inverter.  The inverter is what makes the DC current you generate into AC current that will power your home.  The cost of an inverter alone can exceed $800.  Therefore, the total cost of installing a typical solar system is over $250,000.  This is not including the cost of electricians and other professionals you may require to install the solar system.  With such an exorbitant price, it is understandable why solar energy is too expensive and not worth the investment.  You can read more about the cost to install solar energy systems in this article that discusses the cost to install such systems in different parts of the world. You can also read here about the high cost of solar equipment.  The cost of solar panels themselves make up more than $500,000 of the total cost to install solar panels. You can read here about the high cost of installing a solar system in Australia.  This article explains very well the cost of solar systems in the country.  With an average cost of the solar system in this country of over $42,000, it is clear the use of solar energy for electric power is not a wise investment.  You can read here about the high cost of solar panels in the U.S., where the average cost of panels in a single home is over $15,000.  This article explains why solar energy is quite expensive and unwise to install. If you want to learn more reasons why solar energy is not an attractive option to produce power for your home, read these articles about why solar power is not a cost-effective alternative to electric power plants.  You should also understand that the cost of solar energy may not be as expensive as it seems.  However, the cost of the solar system will remain high in the foreseeable future.  You can read here why solar panels are expensive.  This article explains why the high cost of solar panels will remain for the time being.  There is also a discussion about why wind energy may not be the best idea for home energy production.  You can read that discussion here. You can also read here about the inexpensive, cheap and affordable alternatives to solar and wind energy production."
[INST] I am moving to a new city. How do I plan and prepare - financially - for the move? [/INST],"Here are some considerations as it pertains to finances: 1. Is it a good time to move? As you consider the potential move, determine whether you have good reason to move this time, or whether you are thinking about doing so because you are ""ready to move"" or a change of pace.  I have a very dear friend who was ready for a change, but no good reason to move, so he planned to move to Hawaii and back out of the country, but his job ended up taking him to Hawaii so he couldn't follow through.  (I think he was sad about the loss.) I know others who made moves from a position of strength, and made wise decisions, and the changes helped them to be even better leaders.  The move and challenge helped their personal growth.  If you feel you need to move now, why should you wait?  Do so.  If you're just bored and think you need a change, move forward, but see if there's anything else you can do.  Are you really bored, or is there something else to solve? This will impact your overall financial health because you're taking money and putting it into action.  (You can use it as an opportunity to see if you have cash flow, or whether you need to trim your budget somewhere, and it will be a bit more difficult to control your expenses, as well.)  If your finances are already tight, or you're going to be faced with increased costs, delaying the move may be just the thing.  If you need to move, see if there is any option to delay the date.  When moving, this will give you adequate time to take more steps in advance. (I realize that this should have its own question so I'll provide the link here, then delete the rest of this answer: Is this a good time to buy a house? )  If that answers your question, then you'll know where you are coming from.  Are you buying the house to live in?  Or are you just buying the house to have an asset?  If you are going to live in the house, will this be a step up, or a step down?  Buying a house is rarely a wise financial decision.  What would be wiser is knowing that this move is best for you, and putting your savings into investments.  Be clear that it will impact your ability to invest.  3. Save money for the move itself.  Determine how much it will cost, how much money you'll earn back by selling your house, and how much of your savings should be going to the down payment.  It will help you prepare and also help you when you get there.  Do you need the money now for another purpose?  Can you delay the move to continue building back those savings?  4. Determine your budget, and spend accordingly. I read once that many people move and then find themselves spending more money each month than they thought they would.  The costs that you initially considered weren't all-encompassing.  So plan for the real costs.  How much will your property tax assessment be?  How much additional property tax will you pay?  How much will the additional mortgage payment be?  Will there be other costs - water, sewer, garbage collection, fees for services? (I don't know of the additional costs in the area you're investigating, but you can always call up the town of the area you're moving to and ask for their yearly breakdown of expenses.  These will help you to determine what you'll actually be spending on utilities and other costs).  If you find that it is costing you X per month to save, will you still be able to save?  How much rent and other costs are you looking at, versus what you're currently paying? Do you have enough money?  Can you borrow the money?  How much would it cost you? If you move, and it's wiser to do so, then you have to do the following: (I know this may be covered in other questions, but it's an important part of this question, as well.)  You need to develop a budget so you know where the additional expenses are coming in, but also know that you'll be saving money. You need to look very carefully at how you manage your budget, and how you spend your money.  Will you have the money to follow a budget once you're there?  If not, then delay.  What expenses are necessary and what can be lessened? You are going to have to manage your finances better.  Do you have a plan to do so?  Are you going to be working with an advisor to help","Don't move. There's a huge world out there and chances are you want to do a lot more than one move in one lifetime. Also, moving is expensive and stressful, especially when you have to pay for movers in your own country. And moving is not the solution to the problem, only some of its symptoms, so be careful, as you may find yourself ""chasing"" happiness (like in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty movie) for the rest of your life."
"[INST] Any reason to keep around my account with my old, 'big' bank? [/INST]","As far as I can tell from the comments, most answers focus on a single aspect of the account. But when choosing a bank you should consider the whole. So, you want to consider more aspects than just: Interest rates, ATM fees, check fees, wire fees, and maintenance fees. For me my priorities for choosing a checking account are:","In my opinion, banking isn't the best fit for a business.  The costs of a business bank account are too high and the rewards/insurance you receive are minimal.  If you are a start up and you are concerned about banking with a big business, then by all means go with it, but once you get rolling I tend to go with the smaller institutions.  Also, I highly recommend opening up a business checking account at an online bank if you haven't already. The credit union rates in Washington are a good deal (just keep track of the fee for using your debit card or getting cash back at the grocery store).   Also, with online banking you can do all your withdraws and deposits electronically, so you don't really even have to step foot in either branches.  It also reduces the error rates of transactions and you can get real-time statements online."
[INST] What's the best way to make money from a market correction? [/INST],"There is no one way to do it.  Here is another way:  buy puts.  There is no free lunch but the put can be put on in a way that costs very little and you can do it now.   Puts cost even during a downtrend.  But they cost a good bit less, you get paid if you are right, and they can be structured around the dividend to minimize the depreciation you incur when you are not right.  See if you can get a better idea what I am talking about here:  Briefly, puts cost money on average as a historical matter due to dividends.  But what if you put the strike about your exit price from the stock?  That lets you capture a lot if the company goes down.  Plus, you can have the strike be higher than the current price of the stock so you get paid for holding them when the stock is at a higher level than when you put them on.  And you can reduce the cost if the dividend gets paid during downtrends and you are forced to sell on it like so:","If you're asking for the best strategy, that would be to buy the dip as it happens, but the difficulty is actually knowing when that is. If you are able to consistently pick dips in the market, then of course you should do that. If there was a way to consistently predict when the next recession would be, you would be one of the richest people in the world. You could do well by building a portfolio of undervalued securities that become valuable in the event of a recession. There's very difficult to do though, since most people and other investors are trying to do exactly that."
[INST] Are SPDR funds good for beginners? [/INST],"There are no guarantees, you still need to educate yourself on stock picking etc. You can also have the advantage of DRIP, which will allow you to have the best way to purchase shares of a stock, directly from the company. Most of these big company have high dividends, so investing directly with the money being reinvested in shares of stock for dividends is a great investment opportunity. It is not risky to invest in these big companies, they may have their up's and down's but for the long run with reinvesting dividends, you will come out ahead. Most of these companies pay dividends, which may be tax deducted or can be invested in the same company of the dividend, for more shares to be purchased.","A couple of thoughts. The S&P 500 stocks should be a good investment as they are well-run companies. However, past that it is hard to determine a good stock to buy without a lot of work, even more for mutual funds. Your retirement will last for 30+ years so you need some growth. That means taking some risk, which often means investing in the stock market. The S&P 500 is a reasonable way to do that.  However, it will probably not be a good year or two. This is the time to be investing, not selling. There are no guarantees, but many people predict an economic rebound soon."
[INST] Should we park our money in our escrow account? [/INST],"No. You should never park money in an escrow account. As a borrower you should pay into an escrow account on a regular monthly basis. You should keep an eye on it and make sure that you have an adequate amount of funds for the escrow account. This includes insurance premiums and property taxes. However, when you pay into your escrow account you do not earn interest on that money, for this reason you do not want to keep more in that account than the minimum payment required. To explain this in more detail. An escrow account (also called an impound account, an escrow settlement account, an impounded trust or holding account, a trust account or a settlement account) is often used for property taxes and/or mortgage insurance or sometimes private mortgage insurance (PMI) as well as condominium or homeowners association (HOA) dues at time of loan closing when the amount required to be set aside from the mortgage principal for the above purposes is larger than amount received with the monthly payment. There are rules on reserves for impound accounts, usually equal to twelve months of annual requirements, (these requirements are dependent on the state and its laws), most often the  account is set and maintained by the servicer.  The servicer is usually a  company that sends the monthly bills, and then sends the money, less the servicer's fees, to the taxing authority or insurance company as required.  While a monthly insurance premium on a single family residence is relatively small, it may be in the thousands of dollars for homeowners’ insurance for a 900-family high-rise condominium.  If you have a mortgage on a principal-residence (not an investment property, business property, second home, or vacation home), the tax and insurance money, which otherwise must be paid directly by a borrower each year in a lump sum, is placed by the mortgagee in the escrow account. In many states (including Hawaii, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina and Pennsylvania) where state law requires that principal residences be protected from loss due to foreclosure unless the borrower is more than a few months delinquent on their mortgage, the escrow money must be sent to the taxing authority, the bank or the insurance company, whichever is applicable.  A lender in these states typically places one year of extra taxes and insurance into the escrow account, allowing for higher tax or insurance payments.   Once you are ready to make a purchase, you want to contact a loan officer and begin the process. Be prepared to show your social security number, source of your down payment, and how long you have been in your line of work.  The amount of money deposited from mortgage, insurance premium, and tax payments into the escrow account, must be enough so that if no deposits or withdrawals are made (and there are no administrative, management, and investment expenses), there will be 100% of each month’s amount deposited into the account without exceeding the maximum balance.","If you are asking if you should park the 'downpayments'' in your Escrow account, then you should not do so. The downpayment is there as a guarantee that you will close the deal, and not to be put towards the monthly payments until you take occupancy. If you are asking if your monthly payments should be parked in an escrow account (i.e. like a Mortgage escrow) then I suggest you look further at the monthly payments you have been given. You may be paying monthly payments that include items that are not on a monthly installment and therefore should be pre-paid at a different time. Such as property taxes. (these usually go into an escrow account and are due all at once around the middle of each calendar year)"
"[INST] I've tracked my spending and have created a budget, now what do I do with it? [/INST]",You have a choice of three things to do at this stage:,"I am not entirely familiar with Mvelopes, but do you have a way to track what is spent on which categories of spending? Maybe I don't quite understand your question.  That said, here's what is working for us.  I have set up a budget for each of our paychecks.  Our incomes are not necessarily all the same, and I only have one check that is always the same amount.  We try to set aside a budget amount that we think is appropriate for the paychecks, since they are not the same.  If a given paycheck results in less than expected, we cut back on the next months budget.  So far it's working well.  Having a good handle on our fixed expenses helps when setting our budgets each month.  You can set aside fixed expenses like mortgage, rent, minimum car and student loan payments, property taxes, utilities, etc.  Factor in any known upcoming expenses or expenses that will be paid with savings.  We budget for known expenses like yearly license plate renewal for the cars.  After that is calculated, budget for variable items like:  food, entertainment, gas, and eating out.  You can see why there might be a balance that you are trying to figure out.  Maybe you are spending too much in one category, so that balances out with another.   For us, the budgets are tight the month after payday, and more relaxed the further they get from the next payday.   To help keep our budget numbers straight, we are now doing the entire budget manually right now.  I would have to say it's working pretty well, I like it a lot better than doing it electronically through my bank.  Here is our process:  1)  After reviewing our budget, we create a sheet for each pay period, that we place in a binder.  It has 3 columns: (A) Category, (B) budgeted, and (C) actual.    2)  Our statements from our checking/savings accounts come in mid-month.  We enter all deposits/checks into the register in the correct column.  We don't usually need to adjust the categories when checking our account register, it's pretty straightforward.  2B)  If something is misplaced, or is unknown, we put it in some place holder so we can go back and figure out what it is.  Some of them might be things that have gone to the 'wrong' place on our bank account.  3)  We enter all of our transactions from our checking account, including budget categories.  Since we already have a budget, it's a matter of deciding if a budget category is over/under on a given transaction.  It's pretty hard to put in transactions without making a budget entry (if you have your budget categories set up to pull transactions from the categories, you will get messages that items are not found).  4) Since we are tracking all transactions, we enter other items as they happen.  In the future, we can look back to see this month's total, since we aren't sure what date a bill or statement comes in every month.  At first, its just an estimate.  5)  Since our variable/discretionary amounts are 'adjusted' from our estimated budget numbers, it is sometimes necessary to move a portion or all of a transaction in a given variable category to another.  The transaction was intended to go to that category, but for some unknown reason, it went to another.  One thing we like about doing this manually, is you can do quick tests by adjusting your budgeted amounts to see if it makes sense given your 'actual' spending.  If not, you can then decide what to do.  6)  Once we have our checkbook 'balanced' with our transaction entries in column (C), we add a total at the bottom of each column (A & B).  This is our current budgeted amount and spent amount.  If we are working on a month that is not the whole month (say our paycheck arrived early, or was delayed), we adjust each entry, and then add a new line at the bottom of the actual column.  This will act as a 'placeholder' telling us we only have x amount left to spend during that month.  7)  Once we know that an item was put into an incorrect category, we move it to its real category to reconcile the item.  Once done, we go back to a previous month's budget to see how much was spent at any given 'budgeted' amount.  If nothing seems reasonable (i.e. our electricity"
[INST] Why do some people say a house “not an investment”? [/INST],"I hear this a lot and I don't understand why people say this. The house is an investment. I guess the reason this is confusing is that you are taking the word ""investment"" out of the context in which it is normally used. In common use, 'investment' refers to putting money into a business in exchange for a share of the business' profits.  When you are investing, you typically have little control of the actual operations of the business; you are a partner and not management. When you own a house, you are actively participating in its management, and can thus make an (limited) income as a landlord; you aren't receiving income from any profits of the business.  But even so, consider the following questions: If you bought the house from a developer, who did the initial investment and reaped all of the initial profits when they flipped the house, you are still receiving the benefits of that initial investment after they exited the investment. If you bought from someone else and the developer had passed all stages before your purchase, then you are benefiting from the developer's initial investment. In that scenario, you have received the benefits of another investor's investment. So what's confusing to me is why people see those circumstances differently. Maybe it's because a stock investment (in a publicly traded business) is an even more passive investment than a house? You don't do any work as a homeowner to maintain the value of your investment like the maintenance costs the landlord incurs, so maybe this makes the homeowning relationship feel more actively like a partnership? It doesn't matter to me that I receive income from the house through my expenses. I am still doing business with the house and I am doing so as an investor, so it is an investment. Of course, this applies to other situations. Say you invest in a share of a business in order to get the profit that comes from that business' income.  If you do so in order to also get the benefit of consuming the products that the business produces, then what is wrong with also benefiting from the investment you make? In both of these situations, the profit you can potentially receive from the investment comes from the business you invest in; it is not a ""one-off"" opportunity where you only have the potential profit benefit initially. If you bought the business in order to generate an income, you should consider the business an investment and not just its potential profits. And if you bought it in order to also get to consume the business' products, what's wrong with doing so? (Assuming you aren't ripping off the other owners.)",I just bought a house. There is no way I would be paying what I am paying to rent it and not live in it. I have a tenant paying over a third of my mortgage. I will eventually sell it for more than when I purchased which makes it investment and not an investment. Why would I own a home and have it as an investment if someone else is paying more than half my mortgage on it?
[INST] Dollar-cost averaging: How often should one use it? What criteria to use when choosing stocks to apply it to? [/INST],"A simple way to do Dollar Cost Averaging is to use a 'dollar-cost averager' (or DCA) on the mutual fund industry. Instead of buying any given share as is, you set your dollar amount and the DCA will buy for you each time the amount is accumulated. You can set a date to have the purchases or if you don't want the date to change from payment to payment you can enter 00:00:00 in the date and time box. I have an RRSP account where my contributions are made directly from my pay. It buys for me on the 4th business day of the month and I pick which fund I want to purchase in, and I'm happy with this arrangement. On a smaller time scale it also works to have it make purchases after each paycheck. The DCA will also be used to make purchases with any extra lump sums (such as if you've been saving up for a particular item and bought it early). If you have a savings account or something similar, you can keep it there, or you can contribute some of your paycheck directly to that saving account. (Note: this option isn't available with all companies.) The advantage of taking the contributions from your paycheck directly is that you will save time on administration, don't need to log in your paycheck to transfer later, and it might be psychologically better knowing you don't have to find a way to pay what is sometimes a large amount at one time. There is a small caveat: it can be better to wait for lower cost funds (such as if you choose to purchase them all at once).","Is there an upper limit to how much you would invest per day when using dollar cost averaging? So, say you have $350,000 to invest. Would you invest it all in one day, or invest every $350 per day for 420 days? Would you spread it out over 720 or 2100 days? I don't know of any upper limit to dividend-cost averaging. If you don't care how long it takes to do, you could invest $1 per day, or you could invest $2,475,000 with 25c per day. If you have money to 'sit-on', you could even invest in short-term interest notes and earn a bit of interest."
"[INST] Should I invest in my house, when it's in my wife's name? [/INST]","Yes, refinance the loan for the lowest rate - especially if you can get a fixed interest rate mortgage.  Make no changes to the loan amount. You can get a lower interest rate than 3.330% (this is just too high), and if you get a fixed rate the interest rates are at an all time low.  When the time comes to sell the property you can pay no interest on the sale price of your home over the original amount of the equity.  That is called owner financing.  The interest rate would probably be higher depending on the equity position of the sale. You can even refinance up to 95%.  Most people are stuck with the interest rate of whatever loan product they initially applied for.  You have the advantage of locking in one of the cheapest rates in history.","You have a great question. This will be an interesting read, and I hope I can provide a good answer. Should I finance it with a HELOC at 1.625%, and use that to buy materials to do the finishing I would like to do on the house, such as finish and redo the basement. I don't know what your house needs to do to be ""finished"" but I will start with that. You can use the money from your HELOC to do anything you like with the house, though be aware that HELOC balances get reduced based on your balance so while $100K might sit there a while it will get adjusted and the amount borrowed could be higher than the current amount available. You might want to ask your HELOC service if and how that affects your payments. You need to do your due diligence and take the time to make a list and prioritize the order of tasks you want to get done and figure out what tools you want your contractor to buy for you. You can always buy the tools later and just take care of the basics this time around.   I also considered refinancing for 3.5%. I'm currently at 4.125% for my current mortgage. It might be cheaper interest wise to do it now, but a year from now would make more sense. If you plan to refi now, you'll want to consider the closing costs, but if you do it in the future you might not have to worry about the closing costs, and still get a better overall rate in 1 year.  You may want to do this if you want to do more work. I don't know if you plan to, but your other option is to buy another house and sell this one. If you get something similar or cheaper, you might be able to build some equity and trade up for something else later. This approach is less risky than the others though you will almost always make less on the sale of an existing home than you purchase.  You could also apply your income from your wife's income to that $280/week. This gives you more flexibility for the refi down the road, and can help pay towards the principle without actually being tied to the house as equity.  Your wife doesn't have any money going out for the house. I've been saving money each month going into savings for when I want to make repairs, put towards my goal of buying a few rental properties.  That is something that you both could do. You can put something towards that, and you can use other income from the sale of a house and rental income towards that. She will just have something to work towards later. It's also a good idea for you both to keep the savings, because you don't know what could happen. In our area we have a high number of homes currently up for sale which might lower the price later on. You can use the 30yr term and pay it like a 15yr. If both of you make some sacrifices for now (like buying frozen entrees and meals less often) you can pay towards the principle of the 30yr mortgage without it being a struggle financially. So while you pay about $1K a month towards principle you might have $3K freed up which can be put towards your wife's savings, the house in the future, or other expenses. You can also keep your HELOC in case you want to renovate later (when the kids are older) or if the time is right financially for another house."
[INST] Should I pay off a 0% car loan? [/INST],"3.5 years left on the car is too much to be paying interest on a loan of this size. A good rule of thumb is that any interest you pay on a car is a waste in terms of the interest you're paying on that car exceeds what you would save by not having any monthly payment. That said some factors to consider are any time you have cash sitting, you can invest it instead of paying for interest: if you're in the 25% tax bracket, that is like gaining 25%/yr on your payment.  I agree that you should budget the cash in for the payment as a sort of 'sandbox money' to avoid the temptation. Consider that $10k over 3.5 years @6% is another $3600 on that car so the payment is higher and you'll be in this situation again. Consider the car:  If you really like the car, you can drive it longer to save yourself the cost of buying something else (depreciation) now.  However, if you know you want to upgrade, you're looking at a high loan percentage or less down for a new/used car.  Also if you sell the car to pay down the loan, and then realize 6 months later that you needed the car to commute with, you're paying for the other car now!  You'll also need a car insurance gap protection so you don't get stuck if your car is in a wreck!","Is there a fee/penalty for paying it off early? Then do that. Even if not, I generally consider 0% to be around 3%-4%. If it were me, even if there was no penalty, I would set it aside in savings for 0.1% or less. Take it a step further and open a money market account paying a better rate while you pay it off. Then after it's paid off, you can still keep the cash account in case of emergency. You can look at it as a ""forced"" savings fund in place of making payments. Just pay it off and be done with it, no worries."
[INST] US citizen transferring money to Indian fiance to buy property [/INST],"Are they a US citizen and reside in India? What you are suggesting is ""money laundering"". Since when does she want this money? Is this a transfer of the property or you plan to gift her this? Are you two planning to get married ? Then all these matters come into picture. Are you planning to immigrate to India after marriage? Since these details were not added, so I am unable to get a clear picture from this. And not sure, whether this is a duplicate question or not.","It is legal to send money abroad to someone you are dating. You will be required to fill a W-8BEN form for every recipient of a foreign payment over $30,000 in a year.

[INST] Where can I find filings of HUD-1 statements? [/INST],"My mortgage processor submitted the HUD-1 (settlement statement) documents last week. You are looking at the original documents (the closing package), so they've got them somewhere.  You should be able to look at the settlement statement in the closing package you signed to compare the numbers with the amount on your last payment statement. If your mortgage processor needs additional funds (to pay attorney/broker/escrow/etc fees) they may ask you for an increase; most contracts include a clause allowing the transaction not to fall through if required funds aren't available within a certain period after the loan is approved.","You can get HUD-1 statements from settlement agents in your area, but they won't be available to the public. Why should one exist? What should the information it shows? There is no public purpose that I can see. To me the HUD-1 is just a tool of the banks to keep out of trouble, they are not looking at it as a tool for public transparency and/or consumer awareness."
"[INST] Why do volatility stocks/ETFs (TVIX, VXX, UVXY) trend down in the long-term? [/INST]","First. I did what I assume you intended (sort of) to do, and that's to graph each on their own scales, and to graph their average daily chart.   All 3 were created less than 5 years ago. I added a longer term chart, to show the effect of the market over longer periods. The first thing I noticed was, they started at very different levels, and one was only 4 shares a year in. The other was just under 600 shares a year in. It only took about 3-4 months to hit the 50% loss mark.  The one that was about 600 shares per trading day still is, while the one that had 4 shares in the year's beginning is now around 30 shares and has already lost about 50%. At the present, all 3 are at their current lows.  All 3 are at about 70% or more off the highest peak, while the market has gained just about 10% or so since when all three started. It's clear as day now why there would be the trend there is.   To be sure, you have to understand that the futures market is incredibly complex, so the simplistic logic of buying low and selling high doesn't always prevail. A stock futures market for VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price), is different than one where you are agreeing to a contract for buying or selling a certain unit of volume at a certain price on a certain time. Also, the chart that shows one long term market average that includes everything in the index, doesn't reflect the same average for the individual stocks; and the difference can have a large impact over time. I chose the last 2.5 years to start the weekly average chart, to get rid of the 2008 time frame in the index graph, so as the other averages are reflective of the market at all times, you can see what happened about 5 years ago... it fell out of the sky. It took about 18 months to get back to a point that most stocks were even 50% what they were.","First, read How VIX ETFs Work.  Here's an excerpt to illustrate how the ETFs are managed:  For example, with VXX, the fund has daily cash flow expenses of  15.75%, which it attempts to balance through exposure to a combination   of cash, futures, and short sales. The futures portion of the fund   is rebalanced on a daily basis (each day the fund is valued), and on rebalance days,   some portions of the existing roll dates are liquidated and sold into   the near (6-8 week) term futures market. In other words, VXX starts with an ""investment"" in the term-expiring options that make up the VIX. These options are expensive (VIX options have very high implied vols and delta) and thus their prices will go down when the options expire (or roll forward). Then VXX uses its rebalancing mechanism (selling the near contract and buying far ones to bring in new VIX futures) to make back its cash requirements. This also creates downward pressure on VXX as the contracts that it buys get increasingly farther out in expiration (see the quote in my answer from the whitepaper for more about how far out they might be). So basically, the ETFs are designed to lose money over time. The VXX ETF whitepaper linked to above spells out how this is more or less intentional (i.e.: this is by design, not accident): The primary goal of the   S&P 500 VIX STK TR MTH ETN is to achieve daily compounded daily   correlation of -0.5 with the level of the implied volatility of   the S&P 500 Index from 10% to 20% (as indicated by the S&P   VIXST Index).  The VIX itself is based on a somewhat complicated formula which is also explained in the whitepaper: The VIXST Index reflects estimates of volatility for each of the near and far term   term component 30-day options in the VIX Index based on market   prices of 30-day front-month and second front-month S&P 500 Index option   contracts. The calculation of the VIXST Index is based upon the market   price, at 16:00 p.m. New York time each day (with the exception of Saturdays,   Sundays and New York Stock Exchange holidays), of certain 30-day front-month   and second front-month S&P 500 Index option contracts traded on CBOE (or   successor) (“CBOE”). The prices used to calculate the VIXST Index are based on   transactions conducted, at 16:00 p.m. New York time on the day to which the VIXST  Index relates (each ‘Reference Day’) and such other transactions prior to, or subsequent to such time. The VIXST Index is based on market prices of option contracts of   the same strike price and expiration date, which are traded on the   last Reference Day that precedes the day to which the VixST Index relates.   For instance, with respect to the VIXST Index based on data as of June 5,  2012 (2012/06/05) which is used to calculate the VIXST Index based on data   as of June 5, 2012 (2012/06/06), the market price of option contracts traded   on June 4, 2012 (2012/06/04) is used to calculate such VIXST Index based   on such Reference Day. ...  The VIXST Index is then calculated, on an   actual basis, by taking the (i) annualized volatility rates related to   the front and second front-month 30-day options in the S&P 500 Index and   (ii) the market price of call options on the S&P 500 Index with the same   implied volatility on each Reference Day. Such annualized rates are then   averaged, weighted according to each term’s contribution to such average,   and multiplied by a constant to calculate such index [This VIXST index is the one that VXX attempts to replicate. The   term “replicate” is used here with the caveat that it is the price of the   VIXST, rather than its level, that drives the"
[INST] I'm thinking about selling some original artwork: when does the government start caring about sales tax and income tax and such? [/INST],"Are you in the US? Any of the 50 individual states? I'll assume you are in the US, but the answers I give are true anywhere. Is your 'artwork' a painting that takes a little of your time to complete? Or do you mass produce prints of the same one, or make some variation? What I mean is - would it be fair to say that selling these paintings would more closely resemble selling crafts, or would that not be accurate? Are you claiming any exemption from filing taxes? The simple answer that most folks would give you is: ""If you don't file, then file now before the IRS catches up to you."" Yes, the IRS does care, and there's a penalty for not filing. I'll list a couple reasons why you might have neglected to file, and I'll point out the pros and cons of each one: Selling a few things as your hobby. There's nothing wrong with that. You just have to be honest in your filing. It's more than likely that your total revenue and total expenses will be too little to trigger the paperwork.  If you're doing this, just make sure you do file. Why? Because if you ever decide to start doing this part-time, or get serious about it, then you'd get audited and you'd have a hard time convincing them that you only did it as a hobby. Keeping all receipts and tracking your expense vs. income. It's not an impossible task, but it can be time consuming, and most people don't enjoy it. But, you'd then be able to show that you did keep records of your sales, and could prove everything, just like every other freelancer. Neglecting to keep receipts. This is what most people have trouble with. And this is usually why people give advice that they should just file now and get caught up. A lot of people would rather not deal with the record-keeping, but still think it's more professional to have a business account to put all these charges or income into. You're just going to end up doing a lot more work, but that's your choice. If you're going to set up a business, why wouldn't you want to keep records? As others have commented, you'd be making a business out of this. So, you can do it, or you can say that you wouldn't ever do it again. That's your call. As for what you can expect the IRS to do, if you don't file, expect an auditor from the IRS to show up at your door at some point. Not next week, maybe not next year, but in about 4 years or so. They really can't come knocking on your door before that, because there's no way they can find you. They simply don't have enough personnel. The IRS has been very public about their personnel problems in the last few years (see here and here), and these have created a bottleneck that would prevent them from coming after you tomorrow. You might have heard about people who sell a lot of stuff and never file and never get an audit - usually, the auditors don't catch them until they've reported their income enough to trigger an automatic assessment of the sales taxes and state income tax. Or maybe when the seller is hit with civil proceedings, such as a lawsuit.  So, no, I'm not saying to file. Just think about your reasons carefully, and decide whether you want to keep selling, and decide whether it's worth your time to set up a business account, go to a tax professional, etc etc. In the end, it's your decision whether to do it your way, or have the IRS assess the value of your products against your sales tax account, and then ask for all the sales taxes you owe in one lump sum. They might even impose late fees, interest, penalties, and possible criminal charges for what your business is doing for not filing, not tracking sales, etc.","If your sales are primarily within a single state, and you already have a license to collect sales tax, keep doing that and use that as a base. If not, then start with one of the more popular online auction sites such as Ebay and start there. You don't have to pay an initial fee for selling on Ebay, but they will have fees. These fees and the sales tax will have to be factored into the selling price of your originals, so you're going to need to know how much it would cost you to replace your originals, including your time, the materials cost, the licensing cost, etc. in order to price your work properly."
[INST] Buying my first car out of college [/INST],"The problem with being young and owning a very nice new car is that it takes less cash to purchase and maintain, and more time to build up cash for anything better. The next car you will want, if you go this route, will be a lot more expensive than what it would cost you if you wait 10 years (or about 5 car purchases) and can afford a better vehicle to get you where you need to go.  Also, to add to jwh - if you really feel strongly about getting the new car, and you are in a hurry to replace the current car for cosmetic reasons, what would happen if your current car broke down and you lost both cars?  What is your plan if that occurs?   I'm personally of the opinion that a new vehicle isn't worth the premiums unless it is going to be used in such a fashion that they will actually wear out faster, like constant delivery of a pizza.   For most individuals, buying a car 1 or 2 years old for $20k instead of $30k will still put you in a very nice driving vehicle without the depreciation hit and the repair issues that will come with any automobile the first few years of being owned.  If you are only buying a car when you need one, it is better to buy a better model, because it will still have another couple of years of life in it while you save for the next one, and the overall depreciation will stay less than the new but older cars.","My first piece of advice is get something used, not new. Second, pay cash. New cars loose their value like crazy. New vehicle can be as much as 25% less today 3, 4, or 5 years from now. Your first vehicle should not be fancy, new, or have all the best bells and whistles. It is a transportation to get you from Point A to Point B; no more, no less. You will learn from your driving experiences such as what type of vehicle will be the best, and what type of vehicle you may want in the future. That said, you mentioned owning a truck. In my opinion that is a great choice for your first vehicle. Depending on your situation, you could look into a manual transmission and save thousands over an automatic. My next recommendation is that you do your homework before talking with a dealer. Learn about your vehicle in advance. Go on sites such as consumer reports, review each trim level you could potentially purchase depending on your budget. Make a list of all the features that are important to you and prioritize them. Look up prices for models you may end up purchasing so you have an idea of cost. Finally, and most importantly, always always always ask for the rock bottom price. This should never be a starting price. If your negotiation does not go as planned, simply walk away, and move on to something different. Never ever make that the last deal you will look for. You will never get it, and you will have missed your chance. Good luck!"

I'd suggest that you use an online payroll service (https://payrolltax.intuit.com/nanny-taxes.html, https://www.payrolltaxesmadeeasy.com/nanny-taxes.html), as you're only going to hire a nanny from now and then.

[/INST]","What's the difference between a 'debt' and a 'bill'? Well, what's the difference between a 'moon' and a 'planet'? You could argue that the moon is technically a planet, but generally we just accept it's not the same thing at all. The distinction between 'debt' and 'bill' seems to be a rather similar one, and it's not one that many people will ever care about. It would be like arguing that the planets are all just big rocks floating in space. Anyway, I suppose you could argue that a bill is just a debt in 'the making'. I mean technically: when a debt has been incurred, it is then billed... but that's about as useful as a moon isn't it? At the end of the day: a 'bill' is just a 'debt', but who cares? What does matter, however, is the difference between 'secured' debts and 'unsecured' debts. And this is about as different as a moon is from a planet; if you get it wrong, you can be seriously injured.","Debts occur when the creditor accepts the borrower's repayment obligation. Bills are indications of impending debt. To put this in a practical situation, lets say you pay your monthly rent for 2 years. At that point if you move, the landlord will still be due payment for the remaining period in your lease, until you find a replacement tenant, but until then, even though you have paid for 2 years of occupancy, you would still owe him the remaining months of the lease."
[INST] The board of directors in companies [/INST],"A board of directors is the group of people who have a shared governance role of an organization. Governance is the process by which individuals and institutions set the rules, establish the norms, and decide what actions are possible in the organization. The individuals who have an ultimate governance role of an organization are called board members, and the rules that establish these roles and this group are referred to as the ‘corporate charter.’ In a hierarchy of decision making, a group whose highest rank is the board includes shareholders, directors, and officers. A group, which lacks any governance or oversight role, is referred to as ‘officers.’ The board itself is accountable to the shareholders and, in turn, accountable to themselves.","From what I understand, most jurisdictions have ""limited liability.""  This means the corporate structure offers protection against liability for the stockholders in the event of a lawsuit against the company.  The law considers the corporation to be a separate ""person"" in the eyes of the law, as compared to a sole proprietor.   In theory corporations should have management in place to insure the rights and interests of both sides, the stockholders and the company's debtors or suppliers.  The board of directors is elected by the shareholders to ensure that directors represent the rights of the shareholders as owners of the corporation.   There are a variety of board functions; at the high level are directors who are responsible for overseeing and advising the top-level management.  At lower levels are advisory, audit, compensation, and nomination committees representing the interests of investors, regulators, employee/owners, creditors and/or consumers."
[INST] devastated with our retirement money that we have left [/INST],"The question at hand is not whether you can invest that amount of money and make it grow. The question is: ""Are investments a reasonable method of dealing with our situation, given that we have this debt and the need to finance our current lifestyle with any return we might get?"" If 35k-40k is the amount you have to invest, and you spend 35-40 thousand a year living somewhere besides your sister's couch, then, no, investing what you have is not sufficient. You have to make some cuts to your lifestyle, pay down some debt, and do those other things, or you just can't do it.  The second question is ""Can investments be the main, or at least a big part, of one's retirement?"" It could. This means that you have to take money out of your savings as you need it, and then save enough that the money you are taking out each year does not grow and that you don't need to take more and more as time goes on.  This can work if: I am convinced that the right way for us in our situation is to do that. So, with what we have saved plus a 100K loan, can we live somewhere besides our sister's couch? (Given that we live in Colorado). Yes, it sounds like you can. Just not with the high expenses that you currently have, or unless you win the lottery!  Good luck, Bill!","The advice you are getting doesn't change depending on your age. Investments are not a magic machine that will take you from $0 to whatever you want after you feed it with money, and then shut it off like a video game. If the advice you've seen says that the right investment will have an 8% guaranteed return, then this is just wrong. That investment doesn't exist. If you need $10,000 at retirement, then you need to have that in the bank/retirement account (and of course, that means you probably need $12,000 to account for inflation).  If you need $10,000, then invest in a mutual fund that you can withdraw money from after retirement.  Investing is very hard, and investing is something you should learn about if you invest your money (most likely through your own mutual fund you created in the investing application)."
[INST] How do I evaluate risk exposure to my U.K. bank in light of the possible collapse of the Euro or Eurozone economies? [/INST],"While the Euro as a currency is not backed by a central authority, the Eurozone as a geographic monetary union is a central authority.  Greece is in the news a lot these days.  The press is claiming that Greece is getting ready to default, and it's going to be B-A-D.  Is this true?  The answer is yes and no.  To evaluate, we need to look to some key items. Eurozone and Greek Bonds While the US dollar is the most widely held reserve currency (aka the most used), the Euro ranks second and is used for a large portion of global trade and investment.  A recent article in Le Monde provides some interesting and helpful information, some of which appears to be a bit alarmist. As of the printing date (January 28th, 2012) of the article the Euro is the second largest currency in global foreign exchange reserves, with a total of $6.07 trillion.  This is behind the US’ $4.74 trillion.  The article goes on to state the amount of foreign ownership in Eurozone sovereign and corporate debt is 15%. Here you are able to see the ownership statistics by country.  It's important to remember that the numbers above don't provide an equal split.  The article continues it's scare tactics by describing how a 'contagion' could potentially occur.  If Greece defaults, other member countries such as Italy or Spain may be deemed riskier investments and therefore a possible contagion could hit the Eurozone.  A further claim is how a contagion could cause a 'chain reaction' and potentially force other countries into bankruptcy, eventually leading to a 'domino effect'. The article cites sources that claim the Eurozone has nearly three times as much debt as the US. I did this myself at a previous job and you need to take this with a grain of salt.  A country isn't comparable to the debt of it's residents just as I'm not comparable to the debt of the US.  The data the article is citing is Public sector debt as a percentage of GDP.  According to Investopedia, this means the public sector is comprised of the General Government.  If you dig into where the data is from, you'll find that it's OECD statistics, and they say ""The data are estimates, based   on the latest available data. Total general government debt is the   accrued amount and includes the accumulated outstanding amounts for   all liabilities of the general government (central government +   regional and local government units). Gross general government debt is   measured as a ratio to GDP.   In 2008, the International Statistics Institute produced a publication   which included a report highlighting how Eurozone sovereign debt wasn't the problem, rather that public spending was 50% of GDP in France, Germany and Holland.  The same study showed that Spain, Italy and the UK were about 46% of GDP on public spending.  It's all to be taken with a grain of salt because it still doesn't tell the whole story. Eurozone banks have a lot of Greek debt on their balance sheets in the form of Greek sovereign debt.  Since Greece has taken a path towards eventual default, Eurozone banks have suffered and there has been a run on withdrawals in Greece, Spain and Italy (see Le Monde article above).  One article in Time states that there's 150 billion in Greek debt held by institutions with over 1 trillion in assets.  Bailout The Greek government has been bailed out up to 110 billion dollars, but only if Greece enacts austerity measures. While time has been granted by the IMF, Eurozone sovereigns and the European Central Bank, one of their conditions for the lending was an increase in Greece's VAT, sales tax, from 21% to 23%, and a 10% cut in some 23 pensions.  This has prompted riots and protests across Greece. The Eurozone is trying to solve the debt crisis that is plaguing it, but can't get the Greek government and its trade unions to agree on any proposed solutions.  The issue is that a ""One Size Doesn't Fit All"" approach isn't working, with some countries needing to decrease wages and cut public spending, while others just need to privatize assets.  Additionally, countries in the north see it as ""we have to pay for countries that spend more"" but are not willing to pay a price that","I have the exact same question. I'm in the US, and my bank took a huge bath on the currency exchange, so they lowered their exchange rates recently, and now every time I withdraw U.K. pounds, they charge me a 4% fee.

[INST] What are the differences between an investment mortgage and a personal mortgage? [/INST],"What you're talking about are rental properties. Investing in property is a great idea -- there are two possible ways to do it. First, you can invest directly. Second, you can invest by loaning money to others who are investing. With this second approach, you give your money to someone who will buy a rental property and charge a higher than mortgage interest rate, or pay you a higher than savings account rate. You can also do this directly through a company like Lending Club or Prosper. But, both approaches can give good income to you, over and above inflation.","There are often different incentives, for both. Where you want some security that you have a decent return on your investment in a property, the bank will be looking at how much chance we have of recovering the loan if things go wrong. If your loan is secured against a buy-to-let property, then there is a reasonably good chance the lender will be able to recoup the loan via the property, assuming its sale value doesn't drop below £35,000 or so. That risk is smaller for regular properties since you will need to be paying the loan off for a long time, since you are paying it off in instalments from your salary. If you have a reasonable amount of surplus cash, i.e. if you have lots of credit cards, a very low salary, and no other debts, some mortgage lenders will ask for a smaller deposit and charge you more interest. This makes it a more profitable loan for them. They are also taking a greater risk of losing the loan. If you have more money saved up for a deposit, the bank is taking less of a risk, so you can buy a more expensive property (or one with a more profitable rental income). So with larger mortgage deposits, the bank may be less willing to extend the loan size. However, there are always exceptions, so you need to get quotes for both before making a decision. If you want an investment only, check whether this means only a smaller range of properties or areas."
[INST] What are useful indexes for rapid evaluation of country investment risk? [/INST],"Investment risk analysis would encompass far more quantifiable data than what can be expressed by simply reading a country's annual GDP growth rate. When comparing the data between two companies, for example: there are a number of factors that must be taken into consideration. The relative risks of investing in one country over another are more akin to comparing the investment risks of a small, low-profit generating company with a high, high-profit generating company. When a company such as, McDonalds or Wal-Mart shows up in a list of companies, then one can say that perhaps their risk profile may be different than a small startup company. Similarly, the investment risk profile of a company and a country can be different. In evaluating risks, you must understand what you're investing in and where. You need to develop a set of metrics to evaluate these metrics. These metrics will help to define how these metrics can be used for comparisons. So, for example, you may want to look at things such as population growth rates, gross national products, percentage of GDP from exports, inflation rates, unemployment rates, and perhaps more factors. This gives you a set of data to analyze one country with another, but you need to develop thematic metrics to provide this comparative analysis. You should develop comparative analysis methods, using statistical analysis tools of your own as well as ones provided by different vendors. As an example, in financial statement analysis you usually want to look at a company's balance sheet and their income statement. This would help the analyst to determine whether the balance sheet is properly leveraged, and whether the company is making money or not. If you're evaluating investments in a small, startup company, you would look at things such as the management team experience and their sales, marketing, and product development teams. This would help them to determine whether the management has the experience to execute and whether they're providing value to potential customers. So too, when you're looking at a developing country, you must look at things such as government policies, the ability to form a market, and perhaps the level of literacy in the country. You would also, want to include various risk factors such as natural disasters, exchange rates, and the stability of the currency in the analysis. The type of analysis and metrics chosen should be based on your particular investment objectives and preferences such as the type of investment that will be made. If you are investing to support a sustainable economy or to support an industry, then looking at government policies, stability of the government, and the stability of the currency would be important. If you are investing in a country that is prone to natural disasters and it's impact in GDP, then you may want to look at that impact in your analysis. As an example, if you have a company growing at a rate of 5% per year, you can assume that it's growth will continue at that rate for the next year. But if you have a country that gets impacted by a natural disaster, then you would need to look for data that could help you determine if GDP would continue growing at 5% per year. When evaluating a country's risk profile, you must determine what you are trying to achieve as this would help you determine the type of analysis needed. Also, you need to understand the context in which you are using the metrics to evaluate the risks associated with the investment. You must also consider the potential downside scenario when looking at the risks of investing in a country. This would help you to assess the risks associated with investing in the asset under question. You would be looking at things such as your worst-case forecasting scenario. To summarize, in investment analysis, you need to look at the thematic risks of investing, and develop metrics to be able to compare them. When you develop your metrics, be sure to use context and take into consideration different types of risks to understand the risks associated with the investment. Finally, be sure to include downside scenarios for both yourself and for the country that you may be investing in.","The simplest indexes are debt-to-GDP, public debt, government deficit as a percentage of GDP, currency reserve ratio. Then you can go more fancy. I would not use the Heritage Foundation's indexes... they have a conservative and a liberals index. The former tends to rank many of the Scandinavian nations badly as their tax policies are better than the US."
[INST] Query regarding international transaction between governments [/INST],"You probably already realized it but yes, it is a loan. They expect Japan to pay it back eventually. I could not find any specific data on the actual interest rates but when I searched about ""japan foreign loans"" the first result was from the Japanese embassy in the US, explaining why Japan is loaning money to the US and how it is a good investment. In your quote, you were referring to the fact that ""only $17 billion would be paid back this year"" or something like that right? It was probably just a mistake since Japan has ""already paid back roughly $461 billion"" or roughly 27.2 times the yearly payment. In the US they're going to pay Japan back, it's only a question of when.  Another way to look at this is that there is still a net of +$384 billion that Japan could still loan to the US.  As of this very moment, 2015 is likely to be another good year for Japan with GDP forecasted to grow by +2.8 to +3.5% as the nation makes use of its abundance of cash to stimulate the economy.  There have been periods like this before; for example in the mid-late 1990s, Japan enjoyed a decade long period of surpluses.  After the surplus in 1998 the US began its own deficit which lasted until 2006.  In other words these surplus/deficits come and go like economic cycles.","Your question has nothing to do with banks or finance.  Your question is a question about the value of money.  Why is one currency ""worth"" 10 units of the other currency.  10 units for 10 units seems fair right, but 30 units for 10 units seems silly.  Why would a country accept 30 units for 10 of their own? Here's my answer: For example, if you wanted to send money to India, you know that the USD you are sending will be worth about 25% less there than here. As such, if you send 100 USD to a relative in India, you know that the recipient in India will only get about 75 USD worth of goods or services.   When paying for goods and services at the dollar store, you know that you only have to pay $.60 if you wanted to spend $1. Now, imagine that you had a dollar that was worth $1.50 everywhere.  In that world, you'd know you'd have to pay $1 if you wanted something worth $1.50. It's like a scale.  I can give you 10 pounds of rice or two pounds of beef.  How would you know which to select? Would you give your buddy a ""bad"" dollar or ""good"" dollar or ""normal"" dollars.   Why would you give them something with greater value?  Or, do you only give them dollars that are worth 10% of their value?    Think of it as you sending someone money.  Imagine sending 10 of ""that good"" dollars.  Will 10 of ""this"" dollars be worth $7.  So you send 20 of ""the good dollars"" and you'll have paid $12 for them to get $8.  Or, you could send them 30 ""those not-so-good"" dollars and $4.33, and they'll only get $2.99. Or you'll have to send 40 of ""this"" dollars to get the $7.  Now you've spent $8 to get $7. The value of the currencies will be set based on the demand.  If everyone wanted USD over INR and was using INR for day to day expenses, then USD would slowly become more valuable and INR would be worth less.  If this kept happening, it's likely that the Indian government would step in and stop it.  They might force companies in India not to accept USD as currency.  Or they might put their currency on the market and buy USD in droves.  Or they might buy gold and other currencies on the open market.  Or they might stop trading currency all together, just like gold.  Maybe they'd start backing their currency with something tangible, like land, labor or gold?  At that point, you'd have to look for another currency to obtain goods and services.  You could use USD or you could use other currencies with some degree of value.  It might end up like gold -- which is not a currency but a commodity.  In 1933, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102, requiring the public to turn in all of their gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates to a Federal Reserve Bank or a branch of the U.S.  Treasury Department by January 1, 1934. In 1934 the United States re-established the gold standard but only to the extent that it used gold backing to set a minimum price for gold. In the 1970s, the U.S. government continued to fix the price of gold at $35 per ounce and allow free trade on gold.  Gold went from about $30/ounce in 1969 to over $800 in 1980.  During that time period the USD lost tremendous value."
[INST] Is there a way to claim a car purchase in the tax return? [/INST],"If you purchased the vehicle with the loan being paid off completely, the amount of interest paid is not deductible. You can claim a loss for depreciation, however it is a complicated process because you not only need to write the expense into your business books, you must also amortize the property. I'm not going to get into the particulars because this is a complicated process. It would be best that you sit down with your accountant or tax adviser to guide you through this. If you financed the vehicle (car) through loans, you can write off expenses if you can show that the vehicle was used in your business as the primary mode of transportation. In the case that this vehicle is solely used for business purposes but only occasionally used for personal purposes, but is not used for commuting to and from work (the place of business is within commuting distance from your residence), you may either claim 25% of the automobile costs (including lease payments, interest, maintenance, repairs, insurance, licenses, taxes, and depreciation) or 48.5 cents per mile. The total amount cannot exceed the total cost of the car. But if instead, you used the car for both business and personal use or for the commute to and from work, the percentage deductible would vary. So in conclusion the amount of deductions is based on usage. Your accountant can easily find the appropriate depreciation schedules to show you how to properly calculate the deductions.","I assume that you want the business to pay for the car. If that is the case, then it's an expense for your business and you can write it off as the cost of doing business. That doesn't reduce your taxable income, but it does reduce the net profit of the business. This is not a tax-savvy answer, since you should definitely consult a tax advisor. These are the details:"
[INST] Are variable rate loans ever a good idea? [/INST],"The most common case I see is when people use a credit card, or home equity line of credit to cover the down-payment on a vehicle since the interest rate will be zero for 3 months.  The vehicle, however, will have no payments for at least 9 months or more, depending on agreement. For someone with poor credit, making payments of an already poor track-record will significantly improve the credit score, and once the loan period terminates, a more significant financing contract may be obtained.  I've also seen home equity line of credit used to purchase vehicles for college students to get them to and from college.  It's also a good way to purchase a vehicle then resell it several months later where the buyer will qualify for new vehicle financing rates.  Once financing ends, the debtor returns the loan and pays the balance off.","It may make some sense to use a variable rate mortgage when you have a fixed cost that is decreasing to meet the mortgage.  In a 30 year fixed mortgage, you're paying off about $65,500 of the original loan principal after 10 years when you're 29 years old.  Assuming inflation doesn't dramatically change it then you would need $67,600 of income to pay it off in 20 years from then.  But by then you'll only need $65,500 of income to pay it in 10 years or so.  So you get a variable rate loan for 8 years from now and convert it to a fixed rate in one year.  Or if you have more than $30,000 extra income, you might want to get 15 year mortgage.  And if you have a good bit of extra income, you might be able to pay it off a year or two early and then refinance the rest into a fixed rate. At that point in time you'll know what the prime rate has been doing over 8 years.  The prime rate is currently low, but was 8 to 10% between 1994 and 1998.  I wouldn't borrow money for a mortgage with anything more than 4 or 5 years to pay off under current circumstances, except if you have a clear plan to pay off in 10.  This can be a problem if an emergency comes up and you have to tap into savings, in which case you might have to refinance into a fixed rate before paying it off early.  If you have a good bit saved up, you could pay the extra money into savings and take the loan, or you can do the opposite and not take it."
[INST] How can I get a home loan within 2 years of bankruptcy? [/INST],"There are special home loan options for people who have been discharged from a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. You just need to find out at what point in the process your loan was, when you actually began making your payments, and from some banks I know of like Chase have programs like this. Some lenders require a down payment, while others do not, a loan officer can give you that information.  Most people don't know that you can make as low as $1 to start and then make the monthly mortgage payment while filing the Chapter 13 and then when the bankruptcy is all completed and discharged, the remaining balance is like a second mortgage that is subordinate to the existing first mortgage. So you really don't start paying until the payments on the existing mortgage comes around, but there is a lot more to it than this.   I'm sorry but I don't have all of this off the top of my head. I'm in a hotel in South Carolina and all of my research stuff is in a different place, but that is the rough idea. The main thing is to talk to someone in a bank branch (not call 1-800 and ask) to find out what loan programs are available and to get all of the information.  There are also HUD backed loans and FHA loans and others available that people with less than perfect credit would probably qualify for even sooner than after a bankruptcy. I hope that helps. All the best.","Assuming you're in the USA, you will be looking for an FHA mortgage (one insured by the Federal Housing Administration).  The official FHA guidelines regarding bankruptcy state that: In general, debtors are eligible to apply for an FHA-insured mortgage two years from the date of filing or the date of dismissal of the bankruptcy petitions if they have demonstrated a reliable payment record and that their debts have been resolved. More detail can be found in HUD Handbook 4000.1, paragraph 4-5, found here: http://portal.hud.gov/FHAinsurance/handbook40001.pdf Some banks may be slightly less strict than that.  It would be best to call banks in your area asking them."
[INST] Health Insurance and Disability Question [/INST],"I would like to echo JoeTaxpayer's answer, from my own experience: My son was born with a health issue.  We were offered coverage through one of the two insurance companies that was available in Arkansas when my son was born, and they denied us service because they ""can't do business"" with pre-existing conditions.  I'm still surprised that they tried this after the GWB administration had passed legislation that denied them the right to deny service, so I can't imagine how badly they must need our business.   There are two aspects to our current health care.  One is how coverage is mandated, and one is how coverage is paid for. I want very much for health care reform to be passed based on the principles that I want and not for any other reason, but I am very aware that there is no political support for any of the solutions I would prefer. I want any company that makes a profit to pay the same amount of that profit to the government as a tax as it is paying in taxes for wages and other operating costs.  This solves the issue of how the insurance gets paid.  This solution has a long political history as the Social Security tax and FICA tax.  I really do not understand why a Republican politician would argue with something that could be seen as a revival of the conservative favorite solution in the 1990's.  This is very simple, and it can be justified philosophically either way.  If you object to socialization of medicine, it's still an even playing field.  Health insurance, just like the rest of business accounting, operates on principles of ""income, expenses, and profit"". If a company has to pay the government the same amount as it does for payroll, the company has a new expense and cannot spend anything more on anything else.  They cannot claim expenses for profit, and they cannot claim expense for dividends, either.  It is the same expense as every other cost.  As a shareholder, you would not object to this expense showing in financial reporting, and there is no difference between this expense and any other expense.   If you believe socialized medicine is evil, the profit line needs to shrink to represent the same expense that it is today. The government needs to pay a price for the service, and it has plenty of sources of tax revenue to pay for it.  If the political objection is being paid for that service, the cost could get paid from taxes.  The taxes collected can come from social security, unemployment tax, income tax, anything but sales tax.  As long as those taxes come from the employer paying the employer's share, the company is paying the expense.  The only difference is that, if you believe profit is evil, the company is paying the expense and is getting no return on their investment.  It is also a very simple tax to calculate, as it is on a fixed percentage of the profit, so you do not even need C level executives to come for the company's cost of business. If you believe profit is evil, I'm unclear why you're not for taxing all profit.  This is much simpler.  If I do not understand why you think profit should be tax, then perhaps you should be clearer that you do not mean socialization of medicine.  If you mean socialization and not socialized medicine, please be very clear and precise in the wording.   The question of whether to offer coverage is not answered this way, as there is no requirement that a company offer coverage. However, there is a mandate to offer service for pre-existing conditions.  There has been no discussion of ""how"" to pay for it with health care reforms. As an example, I was not offered health coverage, and that would allow me to spend more money on paying employees more.  I could offer cheaper coverage as a carrot, or I could offer better coverage as a prize.  In addition, I could use any other company's premiums as a way to ""steal their employees"".  This is a way I can ""compete"" to get employees without worrying what the other guy has. Of all the philosophies about health care, I believe there are three that are fair, two that are less fair, and one that is very unfair: If taxes don't apply to wages, and instead apply only to healthcare (or only tax social security), then it could be seen as equivalent.  We still see the issue of a mandate to provide, but still have an option to not provide.  Again, if a company is mandated and allowed this would need to be balanced by ""the right"" not to provide for employees, and it would need to be balanced by the premiums that employees would need to be paid","The health insurance coverage that you can get through the small business administration is probably limited to major medical insurance plans, which are likely not to cover pre-existing conditions.  If you want to use those funds to buy insurance, look to find a plan that will waive pre-existing conditions which may limit their liability. Also look through options in the community you live in, and with what your current employer offers -- they may have options available. And if you cannot find insurance for yourself through those, a stopgap may be to see if you can continue on your ex-employers insurance while COBRA is being negotiated -- some companies will let you remain covered if you pay your portion of the premium costs while negotiations happen."
[INST] Can I actually get a share of stock issued with a piece of paper anymore? [/INST],"This is not an answer to the question of what is a stock certificate exactly what you've got is a print of a screen capture of the certificate.  You could order a laminated print like you have, or one embossed.  It really doesn't make a difference. IRS doesn't care what you keep it in but if they want to they can open an envelope to check.  When you buy shares in an IPO or another issuance of shares you get the certificate in the mail but the mail carrier has no way of knowing what that piece of paper is.  There is nothing written on it to identify it, nor is there anything the receiver has to fill in himself on the certificate so as such the recepient can claim this as a gift.  The broker then sends the certificate to his DTC account which is the DWAC, Depository Trust Company which is controlled by the NYSE.  Once the certificates are deposited the shares can then be traded and the DTC gives the receiving broker credit for the deposit of the shares.  In today's age most trading is done electronically.  Even though your broker may own the stock, the shares may be on loan from another company or institution. IRS doesn't have to see the stock certificates.  You will show on your tax return that you made an investment and when you sold you will show the price you were paid.  Any capital gains or losses will be figured on the amounts you paid and were paid. This is why the ""greats"" are so careful not to give you a specific date the stock can be purchased and they only promise that you will be charged for a share and not be charged more.  This way they can make more profit from the sale. Since they do not specify what the exact share being sold is or the expected cost, you cannot claim the trade to the IRS as being a gift when you buy it.","The physical paper certificates got replaced by stock certificates in the 1970's. That means that ownership title in your name with the registrar is registered in computer records, and you receive the right to vote via a physical record only when the vote is actually called for. See Wikipedia stock certificates for some additional insight into this change."
[INST] Small investing for spending money? [/INST],"I am going to share with you my personal approach to this, but I am not recommending it for everyone since this may result in too much effort and you may not see the benefits if you are investing a low amount. I decided that I wanted a portion of my savings to be invested, but as a young investor I was afraid I would not be patient and might decide to touch this money before retirement. Therefore this money doesn't count toward my retirement but is intended for spending money in my golden years. I started out by opening an IRA (US residents) which requires you to invest at least once per year in order to avoid paying additional taxes and fees.  I chose a low-risk fund (one not invested to much in the stock market) and I set all of my dividends and payments from this to be automatically re-invested. My plan was to rebalance this account every 6 months by selling some of my less risky funds and buying into the stock market which would give me more potential growth.  When the money grew to a total of 100% of my annual salary I bought additional shares of several less risky mutual funds which resulted in my stock being now split between three funds. The dividend pay-outs from these three funds are now set to be re-invested through dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPS) which is another easy way towards automatic re-investing.  Now that my account is split three ways and I have the potential for 3 different investments to grow, the re-balancing is a little more time consuming then the monthly re-balancing I used to do to one fund. However, I have no intentions of selling any of these investments in the next 30-40 years. If I had a large amount of money in this account, this would be a perfect time to purchase one or more individual dividend-paying stocks. To find your own system do not underestimate your work time.  Each investment will take several business days to set up.  Each investment opportunity should have a set time period of time (e.g. for re-balancing) as well as a schedule that you will need to follow.  This will help you from taking action rashly.  (I found I would have to change the schedule I chose initially to accommodate work and my personal life.)  I do not recommend jumping in and out of investments frequently or even weekly.  You cannot win by timing the market.  A better approach is to automate your strategy as much as possible.  I found that it is easy to do everything manually when starting out but harder to continue as your income and investment size increases.  So start early. Also consider your future goals.  What you do for each investment now may be different later as your circumstances change.  (Example:  when you are young you can invest heavily to obtain your higher salary, but when you become older you must have a balanced portfolio of high growth, stable income, and high safety to live off if your portfolio shrinks in the last 20 years.)","At your current income, you should be saving a small portion for retirement each month. IMO, you need to get on track with this BEFORE you consider spending money on your hobbies. Some people suggest a 401k or IRA, I suggest a ROTH IRA even if you can't max out the annual contribution. If you're just trying to save for retirement, a simple index fund is a low-risk solution.   Your retirement savings should be your priority for long term growth even before your debt. Make it automatic so it is not tempting. Debt is not cheap. It can feel cheap when you need it, but those payments can keep you from your goals. So pay that off as quickly as you can."
[INST] Do I need to prove 'Garage Sale' items incurred a loss [/INST],"IRA income isn't taxable, but gains are. So income (including capital gains) from sales is used to determine IRA contributions. In effect, any contributions offset any gains during the year. Any losses do not go on your taxes, so you'll need to track these separately to reduce future investment income. Generally you'll be allowed to deduct business losses (including hobby losses) up to $25,000 per year (from what I've read, not a tax expert by any means). That means up to $25,000 of your capital losses are tax deductible. If you need to claim capital losses on your taxes in order to avoid IRA taxes, but you don't have enough gain (losses in the next two years, if not enough, count towards it) then you can report your losses on Schedule A (under 'Other' itemized deductions) if they would equal or exceed 2% of your adjusted gross income ($13,500 for a single person).","If you purchased the item under $500, and didn't keep the receipt, it wouldn't be worth the time and effort for the IRS.  If you keep it under $2500, you don't have to itemize; instead you can use the ""Sales Tax Deduction"".  If your state charges sales tax on clothing, the maximum clothing deduction amount increases to $3,000.  If you charge sales tax on clothing, and it costs less than $100, you still have to fill out form and save receipts.  It's always worth to get the receipt, and save it, for proof of purchase. Also, if you have more than one sale, and your total loss is more than $500, you can combine the receipts and show an overall loss. However, if you're trying to reduce your tax liability for something like this, I would think twice.   The IRS looks at this as income, and it must be reported.  It's only deductible under the rules above."
[INST] Why aren't bond mutual funds seeing huge selloffs now? [/INST],"You should look at the historical performance of bond mutual funds and the stock market during the past recession.  In short, bond funds did pretty good.  This is why you should have some cash and some bonds in a portfolio.","If we look at the following chart, we see that as the stock market starts to sink in the last month or so, the bond market (as measured by the total return of the AAA bond mutual fund) begins rising about the same time - and you can observe it is rising in kind of a mirror image of the decline of the stock market, at right angles to the stock market. That means that there's a lot of money leaving the stock market and the bonds must be the place to go. Here's a chart of the ETFs for the stock market, and the bond market:"
[INST] What is the meaning of “writing put options”? [/INST],"Writing put options means that you sell put options. You will receive money when you do so. If you wish (and provided the requirements in the contract - strike, expiry date) you can buy put options back at a future date. This may result in loss of money. What the article writer tries to convey is that writing puts makes money in the moment you do it.  It could be also used to mean that you might lose money in the future.","There is no such thing as ""writing put options.""  The writer of a put option is the seller of the option, who receives the premium in exchange for the obligation to pay the long position or to convey shares if the buyer exercises the option.  What you are describing is a purchase of a put option.   If you have shorted an asset such as a stock or futures position, you may choose to buy put options to hedge against loss in the underlying.   What you are describing may also be a covered call position, such as you have shares of T and you are selling a put option for shares of T to protect the stock from a loss in value."
[INST] Why would people sell a stock below the current price? [/INST],"There are several reasons why one would sell below the current price. First is an obvious case of a typo of the sell price (e.g. the sell price was meant to be $86 not $6, but the user entered 6 instead of 8). You already had such a case mentioned in your post. Second is a case where one wants to sell in small amounts, but the stock he's trying to sell is on the block and trades in high amounts (for example, one may try to sell a 10 cent share of the common stock on the stock exchange that has no such shares). Then it will look like one wants to sell for pennies instead of the current price. The third is when one wants to sell just one share so as to bring the price of that share down, and as a result, sell all his shares for the minimum amount, or alternatively if one owns $millions worth of shares, then sell a few ones in order to drop the price in the hopes that others will also sell shares of that company, bringing the price down further. Fourth are people who want to sell all their shares, but do not have enough to cover one full order. Fifth a typo in the buying price, e.g. a buyer typed 08 instead of 8, making the order $50 smaller than what the actual buying price was. And sixth is simply that many people think that in a declining market (which often means that the market in general is becoming less liquid, which means there will be less buyers), there will be more sellers (who are looking to make gains), so it may be better for the one trying to buy the company to sell just a tiny bit less.","Let's suppose that you own Apple stock and you sell it in the stock market. What if your stock gets sold not to another public company, but to a private entity, such as a hedge fund? Well, let's say that your broker is the only company authorized to sell your stock, the reason why they sold the stock and the stock got bought in a split second, no one would know about it or even the value of the transaction. (Of course that this is very far fetch from real life and doesn't make sense, I'm just trying to explain a scenario for which the above would be true.)"
[INST] What happens to people without any retirement savings? [/INST],"The USA has a social security system which ensures that people age 65 and older (or younger based on disability) receive a minimum payment each month for food and shelter. This payment is based on a percentage of your earnings at your highest income levels. If you have not worked much at all or earned a lot of money, then your guaranteed payment is very low. There are other social safety nets, especially if you are widowed or never married. You can also get a state government payment if you are married to someone who was a resident of a specific state when he/she died. Some states also have public funds for public employees. As an example for PA: If you worked for a university or state government, then you can get a small guaranteed payment from the pension that you paid into while working for the state. If you worked for a private local state college, their pension plan is often covered by PSERS (Pennsylvania School Employees' Retirement System). If you worked full-time for a state or local college, then your benefits will be guaranteed. See this page for more info. PSERS has a retirement calculator to compute the monthly payment that you are projected to receive, based on factors such as age, income, length of time served, and the amount that you are now receiving as a teacher in a public school.","If they are lucky enough to live to retirement age, chances are they will live their dotage in squalor, with no access to the things we enjoy as middle class citizens.  Perhaps they will depend upon relatives, friends, churches, or the government to care for them, but often that's not in sufficient supply or even available.  I have read of 3-4 year waits for nursing facilities.  If you can find one, can you afford it? They may also be dependent on the hospital emergency services which are woefully inadequate, being stretched to the point of breaking for those who show up without insurance.  I am often asked if I can pay my bill of $3,000 for what was essentially a checkup.  No, I am a physician with a great deal of debt.  If you're on disability, and live, say, in New York, the state will provide $2,900/month for you and your spouse, which is enough to pay rent.  Don't try to buy anything at the store or you'll end up with a court date on a criminal charge, because it is a crime to have sufficient income to survive yet ask for aid.  You'll need to give up 50% of your income.  Good luck with that!  I believe in the UK (never lived there, btw) they have similar situations. I've read that in old age, it's pretty bad, and I agree.  I don't mean to sound negative or anything, but just realistic."
"[INST] If I make over 120k a year, what are my options for retirement plans? [/INST]","There are a number of options available, including: Roth IRA. You can open a Roth IRA and contribute in amounts up to the annual allowance. The allowance is either the annual income you earned or $5,500, whichever is less.  You could also setup an annuity or an IRA, if you know where you are going to buy your real estate. Most annuities are tax deferred and the account grows tax free. All you have to do is decide when to take the monthly withdrawal. Traditional IRA. Once again, the annual allowances apply here. But, you can put that money into a traditional IRA, withdraw it when you retire, and pay taxes in the year that you withdraw the money. So if the money is placed early in your working career, you may wind up in a lower tax bracket when you pull it out. Solo 401(k). Most often, these types of retirement accounts are only available to the business owner and the employees of the business. If you own the business, however, you can setup a solo 401(k). The amount that you can contribute to this fund are subject to annual allowances. For instance, you can contribute up to 25% (but not more than $17,500) of your income or $2,000 if you are over 50.","Well, you want to stay away entirely from 401Ks.  They are not retirement plans.  At best, they are savings that you have tied up until you can withdraw from them or sell what you have invested, and they are taxed then.  You only get tax deductions if you contribute to them, and those deductions only work if your MAGI (modified adjusted gross income) is below a certain threshold.  I believe the current threshold is $91,100.  You can find current limits for 2014 by visiting: http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Plan-Participant,-Employee/IRA-Contribution-Limits Another plan, more similar to what you should be doing, is a ROTH IRA.  But again, don't let what you read about ROTH IRAs convince you these are retirement plans as you may misinterpret them as such. The following is a great article: http://seekingalpha.com/article/447388-how-the-irs-will-use-the-roth-ira-to-force-you-to-save But to respond to your comment about retirement plans and your wish for taxable income, the Roth IRA has NO income limits.  The only limit is that you cannot deduct the contribution and take any deductions for other retirement plans for the year that you contribute to the Roth.  This limitation is ONLY if your MAGI is in excess of a certain amount, so if you are over what you think is the maximum, consult that article. I've never heard of the Roth EIRAs that that article mentions, although I have heard of a 401K EIRA and have even heard that one may be able to roll an inherited 401K money into it.  I have no idea if those are taxable income.  It is likely that you can roll an IRA into another IRA plan.  I think it might be something like 60 days but I cannot confirm that for you at this point.  I believe the other options mentioned include 6 and 6 and a half year retirement plans from your employer.  I have never heard of retirement plans being made for that long.   60 years is a bit overzealous in my opinion. You can withdraw an IRA without penalty.  However, if you are below age 59 and a half, you will be subject to penalties.   So anyways, those plans are not retirement plans.  Roth IRAs aren't retirement plans, although they can be used as one, and they can be used to pay your bills and you can pay bills with ROTH IRA money and not be subject to penalties. 401Ks are also not retirement plans.  They have penalties as well.  The penalties are generally the same penalties as for ordinary IRAs.  The main differences between IRAs and 401Ks are the fact that 401Ks are usually tied to the  company and that 401K plans allow you to invest a percentage of your paycheck while IRAs take a flat amount that you designate.   It is my personal opinion that retirement plans are investment strategies.  You need a diversified portfolio that will give you an income stream (or a combination of several) until you die.  A diversified portfolio of index funds (mutual funds, ETFs, etc) is a great place to have your money.  The key with this is to reinvest dividends.  As the company's revenues increase, so will its dividend income.  Most companies that pay dividends have long-term strategies to pay higher dividends over time.  Also, these companies may issue stock in this effort (a stock split).   Retirement and investing are the same thing.  You work today, invest, and then retire.  But more and more people are learning the lesson that to truly retire, you need investments that will continue to generate revenue long after you retire and even better, continue to generate revenue AFTER you die (and even the next few generations after you) and then, hopefully, after that, the revenues stop and you go to sleep in the ground (if it isn't your company)."
[INST] Are there cons to paying monthly bills with a rewards card and then paying it off monthly? [/INST],"Yes, paying with the intent to only pay with the money you save in rewards is a negative-sum game: You're only making money off yourself.  Even if you can get the card for ""free,"" 8% is still more than the best return on investment without risk.","No. This assumes you pay the reward card before the end of the billing period, to get the cash back. (Not all cards offer cash back.) But yes, it will be a month after you paid the rent or utilities. That month's bill is paid by the next month's payment on your credit card, since the utilities/telecomm/etc. are going to continue to be paid after you pay them on your card, since your bill will still appear on your card's due date. If you pay the bills on your card but pay your credit card bill with cash or other funds, then you are missing out on the cash back. If you pay the bills on your card and later can't pay your card on time, you can cause additional charges. You cannot get the cash back or use the rewards unless you pay your credit card on time, on the day the bill is due. If you miss the bill, some credit cards will put the cash back in for you, but there is a chance they will not."
[INST] What ways are there for us to earn a little extra side money? [/INST],"The answer to the question ""What ways are there for us to earn a little extra side money?"" is quite simple: Get a second job. This doesn't have to mean you can only take jobs in the same industry as your current employer. There are plenty of part time opportunities in a variety of industries out there.","You and your husband could make extra money by selling items at garage sales or on eBay. You can also get creative and sell items online through your existing internet presence. If you enjoy hosting dinner parties, you could become a dinner host for a dinner club membership."
[INST] Why do bank statements end on *SUCH* wildly inconsistent days of the month? [/INST],"Every bank has a slightly different policy on posting of transactions. What you actually see there is the date it was transferred from the selling (source) bank to the buying (destination) bank. Also, banks do their processing differently. Some banks do so immediately or at daily cuts (usually 11:15pm EST). Some banks would do so in hourly or even biannual basis. So if a transaction reaches your bank by end of day for one bank and not the other, the date of posting would be different. One transaction could go through 2 banks before reaching yours and some banks would not process immediately as they have some kind of checks against money laundering and fraud. It could easily take a full day to be posted so those dates of posting would be different for those 2 transactions.","The banks are in the business of making money, not making good decisions. That makes me a little suspicious of the notion that a day's worth of interest is really $1.004726/day.  So I looked this up to see exactly what that was. It's basically a fraction of a penny.  You would really have to be a miser to save up all that interest.  So if the bank were trying to stick it to you, by making you pay $0.004726, you would never notice it. You'd have to really dig through each year-end statement to find that one entry out of many dozens or hundreds of others."
[INST] How to change stock quantity in KMyMoney investment editor? [/INST],"You should find ""Funds"" and ""Shares/A share"" as separate accounts. The first one allows you to keep track of investments directly, the second one will hold the shares after a share split or dividend, which can be merged back with the first account or transferred to another account. This makes it easier to keep track of your investments.","My understanding is that KMyMoney just keeps track of how many shares you purchased, regardless of whether they're in the form of whole shares or fractional shares.  So, it's possible and reasonable that you could end up with fractional shares. I suppose this could be a bug in KMyMoney, but before you get too worked up, it's at least possible that your investment isn't performing quite as brilliantly as you'd like."
[INST] What are the different types of investments I can make for wealth management? [/INST],"All the answers already cover these topics very well.  The advice you get depends on who you're asking. Every bank, financial advisor, investment firm, mutual fund company has their favorite instruments that they will try to sell you as diversified ""safe"" investments. It's important that you understand what each of type of investment is and what risks/reward are associated with them. (Risk and reward typically go hand-in-hand.) To me, any well-spread portfolio must be comprised of:  The amount that you invest in each of these is dependent on how much risk you are willing to withstand.  If you plan on using the cash for something that you need in the near term, it's suggested to not put any of your money in the Stock Market since this is the area of your investments that are the most volatile; they rise and fall quickly based on things that occur in the economy.  If you're 30 years old and you want to start a college fund for your child and plan on using this nest egg in the next 18 years, then you would want to make sure your money is mostly in bonds, cash-like assets, and real estate.  This is because those markets have a smaller historical volatility, meaning they tend to rise and fall slowly over the course of time. It would take something catastrophic to cause a significant downtick in the stock market or housing market.  However, if you plan on spending that money when you're in your 80's, you would want to start off with more stock and move more toward fixed incomes assets (bonds and cash) later in life.  That way when you are in your 80's, you are protected from inflation (an increase in the cost of products and services that is higher than the amount of money you have) since bonds produce more of a fixed income.  This will allow you to have more money to survive in retirement if you make that switch early enough.  For example, you start out investing all your money in the stock market over the 10 year span before your child's first year of college.  For the next 18 years, your child will be in school and can afford to withstand fluctuations of the stock market without worrying about losing anything for their education.  At age 30, you can start to sell off some of the stocks you were holding and buy up some bonds and cash-like equivalents.  By buying these later in life, you will more likely to find lower yields for fixed income investments; fixed incomes are the rates of interest (yields) that a government or corporation will pay you for the money that you loaned them.  So you will have to take in less income for investing those assets.  However, you'll also be able to sell them in a down market (like the current market) and lock in any gains that the investments saw while you still held them. You'll still be able to make money in the down market if you hold them until the market improves again, but you will not be able to sell them at that high of a price you're getting if the market does go up. A well diversified portfolio is important, but it won't guarantee you a 20%, 6%, or even 1% return on your money over a specific period of time. A well-diversified portfolio is important because it provides a balance between volatility and return.  Meaning you get paid more for the risk you take on, and you take less risk than you had previously with a single investment.  That provides both more predictability in future returns as well as a safer return on your investment.",The following are only 3 ideas on how to generate wealth:
[INST] Why do governments borrow money instead of printing it? [/INST],"A country can technically do it. Most don't, for the reasons given, and for more: the consequences of that. The thing that you have to understand about government is that they can just seize other people's money. ""Taxes"" are nothing but mandatory seizures and the government gets a huge cut. This means that if they start printing money, then people's money will lose value. This means that people (who already don't like taxes and have been pushing for less taxes for years) will want even more taxes reduced. Because of this, the government (and the central bank that prints money) would rather sell bonds than print money. Bonds are issued debt. If too much debt is issued at a time, then the government raises interest rates. So the bond market has a cap on debt (how much debt they will allow the government to take on for a given interest rate). If that cap is passed, then the government must choose to issue a higher interest debt, or a lower issue debt (lowering the cap). So to say it another way, the debt market sets a cap on how much new debt that the government is allowed to issue (at any given rate). That cap is set by whatever the bond market will accept - meaning the new debt is accepted when the demand for it is high, low debt is not. This means that the debt ceiling - the ""maximum total amount of debt that the government can have at any one time"" - can change quite dramatically (depending on the amount of debt that is currently being offered, it only requires a small number of people to say ""nope, I am done"" and the market will decide to not buy the debt. At this time, it would drop the cap on a debt. So essentially, it is a very complicated system of how much debt the government can have, because it is based on supply and demand. The Fed sets the cap on supply, based on how much debt the government has (and what their interest rate is). The demand is based on the market. If the Fed raised interest rates, then demand would fall for the debt, and supply would go up. So you can see a way that the two could collide.","In the short term it's much much easier for any government, with some exceptions like the European Union, to borrow and print.  It's much quicker to print than to borrow, and they can have the money much faster.  It would be the equivalent of them going to the central bank, putting a ton of cash on the table (or wherever they do their business), and asking to borrow the cash instead of putting the cash on the table. With that being said, the answer lies in the consequences. So there are some who do print, but they eventually realize what happens.  A lot has already been said about this, but I recommend this particular article of the US History at Work series if you'd like a better understanding of how it affects the economy, and why it's frowned upon. Another way to look at it might be this: Let's imagine there is a new bank that has popped up on the banks of the Missouri River.  Let's say there is a ton of gold there, and a very little bank account balance.  This bank just issues a ton of money and is the only bank for 3 or 4 million people. Those people rush to the banks, and the bank is able to lend the money to people, but it has no money of its own to give to the depositors, and it slowly starts running out of gold.  The depositors ask why the bank isn't lending to them, but the bank has run out of money.  As the economy deteriorates, the bank decides that it's no longer beneficial to lend money, it doesn't have to because this area doesn't have any competitors.  They decide to just print money even though they know they have no gold, and start giving money to people, and things start improving again.  The bank's economy starts improving, but the central federal bank is not happy with this.  The Federal Reserve steps in and gives large interest rates to the bank with the gold, and low interest rates to this bad bank. The bank with the gold, with their healthy economy, decides they might make more money with this bad economy across the river.  Everyone starts going there, so the bad bank gets into financial trouble.  You now have both a bad bank that has printed money to excess and a good bank with no interest on money lent out.  The good bank has a lot of its money given back to them, and now there are two bad banks (and one good).  You now have inflation, not in the first place because of money the bank doesn't have printed, but from the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve decides it doesn't like this, so it raises interest rates to the good bank and lowers interest rates to the bad banks.  Now the economy looks worse in the federal bank, and there is the opposite problem of interest rate differences (the problem started with one side but the Federal Reserve created the opposite problem with the second side of the river).  Eventually, the Fed stops creating interest rate differences and the economy begins to balance out by itself.  If the Federal Reserve doesn't do anything there would still be problems, but it becomes harder for it to fix them.  But for the sake of this example, the Fed stops creating differences, the bad banks improve and the good bank decides it's too bad, it would rather just make money instead of lending it out at interest rates with a government it's not happy with. So the banks balance out by themselves, and the economy is just the normal economy as it was previously, but the bad banks created a lot of damage along the way.  It is likely that they will keep doing this, so I'm going to pretend that they will.  Eventually, the people get fed up with the bad banks and decide they don't like them.   They go to the good bank, which would take their money and give it to the Federal Reserve to take some out of the banks, but this causes problems because this time the Federal Reserve created an inflation.  The people complain and some are unhappy at the bank, while others don't see a problem with it. People think the Federal Reserve is causing the inflation by giving the money to the Federal Reserve, but that is not the case.  The inflation is caused by the lack of lending when the economy does balance out. The people think the bank is causing the problem because they printed the money, but the inflation is the result of inflation itself (not printing the money, but printing more money than is available in the total wealth of the economy) and the Fed giving out the first place, so they blame the first bank for printing too much money when it was them who inflated the currency. Now let's look at what happens next: The economy"
[INST] Is it possible to sell a stock at a higher value than the market price? [/INST],"Yes, it is possible to sell some types of shares at a price higher than the market intra day price. The only way it would be worthwhile to an investor to do this would be if they hold shares in a company and they wish to divest themselves of those shares, yet there exists no buyer willing to meet or beat the intra day price to do so. If they own American Depository Receipts or Global Depository Receipts they can sell them on the market at the current price, or they can sell them to the depository bank at a lower price than the current market price (the bank charges a commission and other fees for this).","You cannot sell at higher than the market price, but you can sell at the lowest price at which other people in the market are willing to buy.  This price is called the market clearing price.   The market clearing price occurs when the number of people willing to sell shares at a particular price and the number of people willing to buy shares  at a particular price are in balance, in the sense that total quantities of shares are equal.   You can get in balance at a price lower than the market price if you are willing to sell more than other people want to buy at that price.   If you are willing to sell 100 shares and other people are willing to buy only 50 shares, then you can get in balance at a lower price, though you will have sold all the shares, and the market clearing price will be different at different times.   What you cannot do is sell 100 shares at a lower price than others are currently willing to buy them, nor can you do better by selling to somebody else who is willing to pay a higher price.  It's all in equilibrium at the present market price.   However, there are ways of manipulating the market such that you can get to the clearing price at a lower price, though how long it will stay at that lower price depends on other market conditions.   You cannot do this if you are only willing to sell 100 shares."
[INST] Should the price of fuel in Australia at this point be so high? [/INST],"Oil prices are mostly determined by speculators who buy fuel futures.  These guys don't have any skin in the actual refining and transportation business, so their view of risk is more skewed by macroeconomic factors than actual supply.  They might be thinking that future fuel demand will be high due to low interest rates or increased consumption in BRIC countries. Maybe they're trying to front-run the Fed's quantitative easing program.  There's some correlation between the strength of the Australian and Chinese currencies, and the US dollar, and many futures traders are concerned that the dollar is in a long-term downtrend.  If you believe in the theory of currency cycles then there's evidence that the dollar will remain weak relative to many emerging and developed market countries, including China, Japan, and Australia.  So if the dollar keeps moving down, the value of commodities denominated in dollars should increase. That's what speculators are assuming. In any case, because of their activities, the price of gas/petrol has increased.  The cost of transporting fuel through pipelines, storage tanks, and on tanker ships hasn't really changed -- so this is something that's difficult to solve with infrastructure improvements.","With an increase in fuel prices comes a greater focus on alternatives. Fuel companies are increasingly investing in new resources like hydro-power and wind power to counteract the rising demand for fuel and meet increasing environmental regulations against pollution. One way that businesses can reduce their spending on fuel is by exploring ways to use renewable energy sources. By using solar panels to generate electricity, for instance, they could reduce the amount of money they spend on fuel. An alternative to reducing fuel prices directly is to reduce the number of cars on the road. One way of doing this is to provide public transportation. This would reduce the need for individual cars while providing an affordable alternative mode of transportation. Additionally, cities and towns could implement bike lanes and create bike share programs. Finally, the rising demand for fuel has fueled research and development in new, more efficient ways to power vehicles. This could reduce fuel prices in the long term."
[INST] Can I borrow against my IRA to pay off debt or pay for a car? [/INST],"The answer to the title question is No, but I think I will provide a bit of context here instead of just answering the question. The IRA is not about borrowing.  It is an acronym for individual retirement account.  IRAs are established for the purpose of investing money for your retirement. Yes, the question is about taking distributions to buy cars etc. but it should be understood that 1) taking those distributions is an irrevocable decision, 2) you cannot replace that principal, and 3) you can potentially be subject to income tax and penalty fees for the distributions. Yes, there are a lot of ""penalty"" free distributions but most people don't consider those. In summary, why risk your retirement savings on a car or paying off debt?","You should not buy real estate, borrow, or use your IRA.  Here is why. As a general principle, never put your IRA at risk. If it is a retirement account, and something happens your retirement account will likely be the last asset taken (by the creditors and courts), leaving you to fend for yourself during a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, or a divorce case. As a practical matter, your IRA assets will be much more at risk. An IRA is a tax-advantaged account.  If you make a mistake that disqualifies it by commingling assets, or by buying things that are considered prohibited by the IRS, your account will be taxed and fined, and you will lose any deductions, like deducting interest on debt used to purchase an investment.   A general rule: If you aren't sure, don't do it! That said, real estate is risky enough as it is, and it is ill-advised to take out a loan on an IRA.   Borrowing against a retirement account will decrease your investment returns, which should be the primary objective for retirement investing. You could find a low-risk investment that pays a decent return which will grow in value, and that gives you the dividends on the income you desire; then you won't need to dip into capital. If you buy property, then you need to maintain a property. You need to pay utility bills, or rent it, make the condo fees, taxes, or land lease payment, and pay someone (i.e. a property manager) to maintain the property if it's vacant. Real estate doesn't pay dividends every month.  The property could sit vacant for a while before you can find a renter. It will not pay you on time, either.   You could go through three-to-six months before rent or condo fees are due.  Then, you still need to pay interest on your debt and pay the fees for the loan if you took a mortgage.  You should not invest in real estate, a rental property, buy a vacation or home to live in, unless you pay cash for it, with the investment money you've been contributing to the IRA. Otherwise you will risk taking on more investment obligations than you can handle, and will make a mistake that disqualifies your investment account and have it taxed.  I suggest not buying real estate and not paying back any debt. Pay down debt aggressively. If you can't maintain the current investment you have, or you don't feel certain you're doing the best you could be doing in that investment, then take the money out and invest in the stock market (or mutual funds in an advisor recommended mix) until you can get all your debts paid off.    Take your mortgage, car loan, credit cards, and any other debts and pay them off if you can. Then invest in something very low-risk. If you must borrow, buy a mutual fund, and invest it back into the market as soon as you can. That way, you aren't putting yourself in a financial situation where you risk tax penalties, and you will save the amount of money you would have paid to the creditors and the court in debt and bankruptcy fees. Finally. Why would you sell your company shares and buy something as risky as real estate, when the dividends will be paid every month?   You will make money, which will increase your current investment asset (your company shares), which is much safer than the investment in real estate.  Once you have the real estate paid off, it will still not be as safe as the current dividends on your company investment.  Instead of increasing the current investment, you will have taken on an additional investment that is much lower-return for a much higher-risk."
[INST] What happens when a non-U.S. citizen who's been making money from the U.S. moves to the U.S.? [/INST],"First it's recommended that you file as non-resident alien 8833. You can only do this if you have your green card. 1040NR is the form you’ll be filing, and you’ll need to find more information here about the tax forms. These forms are different than you are used too. You do have your green card so you are a lawful permanent resident. That means you fall under the “Green card test” and must prove you have been here for 183 days or more. Also, you can’t leave the country for 330 days, or you may have to prove you are still a resident, you won’t be exempt. Your income tax does not change. You will be paying Federal tax, but you should be okay for state income tax. You can not have other insurance. You can keep your health insurance in your home country, but you have to pay taxes, and you should consult with an international tax specialist. You have to provide your international tax specialist your green card and your proof that you meet the residency test. They will help you through the process because you need a lot of records and legal documents to move over. They will explain the tax structure so you know what to fill out for 8833. You also have to provide them with records you had in your home country so they can file the correct international forms.","In effect, you'll be moving your life elsewhere; just as you did when you moved to Texas. It will be your income tax home. You will pay taxes on income earned in your new life. This will also be the location of your residence for IRS purposes. You seem to have a problem with the law, but not with the way of life: If I make a ton of money from my US businesses then I will have to pay tons of taxes to the government of the US and I don't really want to do this.  Taxes are a cost of doing business, like shipping, packaging, and utility bills. However, the U.S. taxes the life you're now enjoying because of all the money you've generated. This tax is income taxes on income earned in the US. If you're not going to be in the U.S., you won't have to pay this tax anymore. In addition, you don't want to pay taxes on your income from the U.S. because you are paying them even though you are no longer there. I'll assume you're talking about this when you say ""I will have to pay tons of taxes."" This will be the new tax burden of the taxes you owe because you are living here and not there. If your business are making money, you would owe tax. If the business are operating in a state-free jurisdiction, then there will still be U.S. federal taxes. As an income tax resident, you need to file a tax return. The tax return will need to show the expenses of living overseas and you will have to show that you are, in essence, out of the U.S. for at least 30 days. If you are physically absent, you can elect not to have tax imposed (no tax) for a period of time. I'll also assume this is what you're talking about when you're saying to ""pay taxes to the government of the US."" In general terms, as far as the U.S. government is concerned, the taxes you pay in another country are foreign taxes. If the tax treaty allows you to claim credit for such taxes, then you can pay tax credit for such foreign taxes. If not, those taxes would simply be ignored.  However, even in this case, you should be clear that you're no longer paying taxes from the income you've earned in the U.S. rather it is taxes you owe because you are the income tax resident in the U.S. for that year. There was no reason to be living in the U.S. if you didn't want to be there and it seems odd to complain about taxes you would now owe if you stayed.  In most countries, tax obligations are calculated based on residence, not where you are from. This is how a ""U.S. person who lives abroad is treated as a U.S. income tax resident"", even if they hold foreign citizenship. A ""U.S. income tax resident"" is a person who is taxed by the U.S. government on their income. It has nothing to do with nationality. As a non-U.S. citizen you have had to meet certain ""substantial presence"" tests each year in order to be taxed. I don't know why you're complaining about this fact, which is a long-standing principle of the U.S. tax code. You've lived and worked in the U.S. now you have to pay some U.S. taxes on income derived from work in the U.S., plus any capital gains on the sale of U.S.-based investments. The rest of your income? That doesn't show up as U.S.-sourced income or you'd have claimed it on your U.S. tax return."
